    "title": "The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape",
    "text": "At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z >= 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.",

    "text": "We report the discovery of three Milky Way satellite candidates: Carina IV, Phoenix III, and DELVE 7, in the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE). The candidate systems were identified by cross-matching results from two independent search algorithms. All three are extremely faint systems composed of old, metal-poor stellar populations ($\\tau \\gtrsim 10 \\lesssim -1.4M_V = -2.8;\\ r_{1/2} = 40 {\\rm pc}M_V = -1.2;\\ r_{1/2} = 19 {\\rm pc}$) have half-light radii that are consistent with the known population of dwarf galaxies, while DELVE 7 () is very compact and seems more likely to be a star cluster, though its nature remains ambiguous without spectroscopic followup. The Gaia proper motions of stars in Carina IV () indicate that it is unlikely to be associated with the LMC, while DECam CaHK photometry confirms that its member stars are metal-poor. Phoenix III () is the faintest known satellite in the extreme outer stellar halo ($D_{\\rm GC} > 100M_* = 60^{+120}_{-40} {\\rm M_\\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite with kpc.",

    "text": "We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.",

    "title": "Compositional difference-in-differences for categorical outcomes",
    "text": "In difference-in-differences (DiD) settings with categorical outcomes, treatment effects often operate on both total quantities (e.g., voter turnout) and category shares (e.g., vote distribution across parties). In this context, linear DiD models can be problematic: they suffer from scale dependence, may produce negative counterfactual quantities, and are inconsistent with discrete choice theory. We propose compositional DiD (CoDiD), a new method that identifies counterfactual categorical quantities, and thus total levels and shares, under a parallel growths assumption. The assumption states that, absent treatment, each category's size grows or shrinks at the same proportional rate in treated and control groups. In a random utility framework, we show that this implies parallel evolution of relative preferences between any pair of categories. Analytically, we show that it also means the shares are reallocated in the same way in both groups in the absence of treatment. Finally, geometrically, it corresponds to parallel trajectories (or movements) of probability mass functions of the two groups in the probability simplex under Aitchison geometry. We extend CoDiD to i) derive bounds under relaxed assumptions, ii) handle staggered adoption, and iii) propose a synthetic DiD analog. We illustrate the method's empirical relevance through two applications: first, we examine how early voting reforms affect voter choice in U.S. presidential elections; second, we analyze how the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) affected the composition of electricity generation across sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables.",

A total of 27 transitional elements and six diagonal matrix elements coupling 11 low-lying states, were extracted from the measured cross sections. These were used to calculate reduced transition probabilities, spectroscopic quadrupole moments, and rotational invariant shape parameters, providing enhanced precision and expanding on previous studies. The experimental data were compared within several theoretical frameworks, including the generalized triaxial rotor model, configuration interaction shell-model calculations, and computations within the combined frameworks of relativistic density functional theory and the five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate a good agreement with the experimental data and, in conjunction with calculations using a two-state mixing model, support significant triaxiality and strong mixing between the and states. This results in the magnitudes of their respective quadrupole deformations being more similar than previously observed. The implications of these results for understanding the complex shape coexistence phenomena, the role of triaxiality, and shape evolution along the Ge isotopic chain are discussed.",

    "text": "Three black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Milky Way show rates of period decay which cannot be easily explained by standard mechanisms. Recently, it has been claimed that the anomalous period decays in two of these systems may be explained by dynamical friction due to very high dark matter (DM) densities around the black holes. We critically assess these claims by performing -body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes\". We simulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as studying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context. These simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial role and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits on the steepness of DM density profiles required to explain the period decay in these LMXBs, requiring in XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00 and in Nova Muscae 1991. Improved modeling of the long-term evolution of binaries embedded in DM spikes may allow us to exclude even larger densities in future.",

    "text": "We present an extension of our semi-analytic model that follows the formation of Population III stars and their metal-enriched descendants, incorporating dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological -body simulations and feedback from reionization. Our extended model is calibrated using two complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves individual Population III and II stars to , and Renaissance, which is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z \\sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good agreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in number of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold . Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations. Finally, we apply our model to larger-volume dark matter only simulations and predict active Pop III sources at lie within the area strongly lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416 with a magnification exceeding . These results demonstrate that semi-analytic approaches, when calibrated to hydrodynamical simulations, can provide accurate, computationally efficient predictions for the earliest stages of cosmic star formation.",

    "text": "We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W<30 mag) z>3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5<z<8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (<200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at ~4 m, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.",

    "text": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z < 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.",

    "text": "The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method originally proposed for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, in which cell averages and point values at cell interfaces are evolved simultaneously. This paper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic problems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a degenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the derivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations within a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The evolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring conservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables are updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete Fourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order SSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is in 1D, as obtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed method is further applied to the porous medium equation, and positivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the non-negativity of the numerical solutions. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and efficacy of the method.",

    "title": "Uncertainty Quantification for Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning",
    "text": "Retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) is a recent evolution of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that employs multiple reasoning steps for retrieval and generation. While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains vulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) offers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods, however, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step retrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for RAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising from retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources and introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ method for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning process by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations alter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies the generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop, the retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling us to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five popular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by over 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines. Extrinsic evaluations using R2C as an external signal further confirm its effectiveness for two downstream tasks: in Abstention, it achieves ~5% gains in both F1Abstain and AccAbstain; in Model Selection, it improves the exact match by ~7% over single models and ~3% over selection methods.",

Owing to their very high temperatures and inflated atmospheres, UHJs are among the most favorable targets for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, enabling detailed characterization of their atmospheric properties. Here, we present a reanalysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectra of the extreme ultra-hot Jupiter (EUHJ) WASP-178b, aimed at precisely characterizing its atmospheric composition. Our approach combines data reduction using two independent pipelines, lightcurve modeling with robust detrending techniques, and rigorous atmospheric retrievals. We report statistically significant detections of CO (7.24 ) and CO (7.22 ), along with marginal evidence for CH (1.34 ), but no clear evidence for HO, suggesting depletion.

Besides the widely studied , , and processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the process can provide a credible alternative to / processes.",

    "text": "The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying small MPSs, each with bond dimension . Our method gives a worst case scaling of as and for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required s are much smaller than the worst case.",

We leverage the 0.3 deg covered to date by COSMOS-3D using NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75<z<9.05. We present our catalogue of 237 [OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII] LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg field. This estimate is in good agreement with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance.

    "title": "Variation of the disk thickness across ice bands: A method to determine ice abundances in highly inclined protoplanetary disks",
    "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.",

    "text": "For any elliptical potential with an external parallel shear, Witt has proven that the gravitational center lies on a rectangular hyperbola derived from the image positions of a single quadruply lensed object. Moreover, it is predicted that for an isothermal elliptical potential the source position both lies on Witt's Hyperbola and coincides with the center of Wynne's Ellipse (fitted through the four images). Thus, by fitting Witt's Hyperbolae to several quartets of images - ten are known in Abell 1689 - the points of intersection provide an estimate for the center for the assumed isothermal elliptical potential. We introduce a new figure of merit defined by the offset of the center of Wynne's Ellipse from Witt's Hyperbola. This offset quantifies deviations from an ideal elliptical isothermal potential and serves as a discriminant to exclude poorly fitted quadruples and assign greater weight to intersections of hyperbolae of better fitting systems. Applying the method to 10 quads (after excluding 7 poorly fitted quads) in Abell 1689, we find the potential is centered within 11\" of the BCG, X-ray center, flexion-based center and the center found from a total strong lensing analysis. The Wynne-Witt framework thus delivers a fast, analytic, and self-consistency-checked estimator for centers in clusters with multiple quads.",

In this work, we use the European VLBI Network (EVN) to (re-)localise FRB 20121102A and its associated persistent radio source (PRS). We confirm that the two are co-located -- improving on previous results by a factor of ~4 and constraining the FRB and PRS co-location to ~12 pc transverse offset. Over a decade, the PRS luminosity on milliarcsecond scales remains consistent with measurements on larger angular scales, showing that the PRS is still compact. We also present the detection of 18 bursts with the Nancay Radio Telescope (NRT) as part of our \\'ECLAT monitoring program. These bursts, together with previously published results, show that the observed dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 20121102A has dropped by ~25 pc/cc in the past five years, highlighting a fractional decrease in the local DM contribution of >15%.

Yet, direct constraints on the HI content of galaxies at z>6 have been scarce. With JWST, Ly damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of this neutral component. We analyse JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra of 12 UV-luminous galaxies from the REBELS-IFU program at z~6.5-7.7, deriving HI column densities by modelling Ly damping wings. Significant damped Ly absorption is detected in eight galaxies, with cm. We use the column densities and sizes derived for these sources to estimate their HI mass and compare with - calibrations. The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those inferred from [CII], although the [CII]-based estimates are systematically larger, suggesting that the HI reservoirs may extend beyond the [CII]-emitting gas. We also combine the DLA-based measurements with FIR-derived dust-to-gas ratios, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicities. No correlation is found between DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the REBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a strong correlation between and metallicity. These findings suggest that by massive galaxies can already host substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with /-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the highest redshifts (), however, we see tentative evidence for systematically lower / at fixed metallicity, which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust destruction/expulsion.",

We map emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas using [N II]/H, [S II]/H, and [O III]/H. Relative to z0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower [N II]/H and [S II]/H and elevated [O III]/H, consistent with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O III]/H profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N II]/H also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N II]/H and velocity dispersion (), linking local excitation to turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies ( 16% of the sample) host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/H, high EW(H), and V_RMS = km/s, indicative of weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 Msun/yr and kinetic powers 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or H). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with scaling relations across 0 < z < 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with $L_{AGN} \\geq 10^{43}$ erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.",

    "text": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a cornerstone of modern recommender systems, has been dominated by discriminative models that react to past user behavior rather than proactively modeling user intent. Existing generative paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact, delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.",

    "title": "The chemodynamical memory of a major merger in a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue I: A golden thread through time and space",
    "text": "Understanding how the Milky Way's present-day structure was shaped by past major mergers is a key goal of Galactic archaeology. The chemical and dynamical structure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major accretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day orbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the merging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that stars born in the progenitor's core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and chemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and metal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Sk\\'ulad\\'ottir et al. (2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context. The preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The median abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar, though less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported by Sk\\'ulad\\'ottir et al. (2025), with relatively good agreement at the highest metallicities. Our results reveal that spatial and temporal memory is retained across the merger -- connecting birth locations to present-day properties like a golden thread. We demonstrate that selection methods in integrals-of-motion space systematically bias progenitor reconstructions by missing its enriched core, and we outline strategies to obtain a more representative census of accreted stars.",

    "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope enabled the first detection of several rovibrational emission lines of HD in the Orion Bar, a prototypical photodissociation region. This provides an incentive to examine the physics of HD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation by collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD formation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art PDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can be used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting region. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon PDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and synthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in the gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and that the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2 transition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the observations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2 dissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2 peaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We derive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high continuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 m, no pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows that a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10 K cm with no strong constraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD observations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from H2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD emission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal pressure in the PDR.",

Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics.

Poseidon supports a broad range of graph workloads, from simple transactions, to top-k beam search algorithms on dynamic graphs, to whole graph analytics requiring multiple full passes over the data. For example, real-time fraud detection, like many other use cases, needs to reflect current committed state of the dynamic graph. If a users cell phone is compromised, then all newer actions by that user become immediately suspect. To address such dynamic graph use cases, Poseidon combines state-of-the-art transaction processing with novel graph data indexing, including lock-free maintenance of adjacency lists, secondary succinct indices, partitioned heaps for data tuple storage with uniform placement, and innovative statistics for cost-based query optimization. The Poseidon engine uses a logical log for durability, enabling rapid evolution of in-memory data structures. Bulk data loads achieve more than 10 million property values per second on many data sets while simple transactions can execute in under 20ms against the storage engine.",

The cost of control is proportional to the magnitude of adjustments. This paper characterizes the optimal policy and the value in a class of multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control problems. These problems involve a linearly controlled one-dimensional stochastic differential equation, whose coefficients, along with the cost functional to be optimized, depend on a multi-dimensional uncontrolled process Y. We first provide general verification theorems providing an optimal control in terms of a Skorokhod reflection at Y-dependent free boundaries, which emerge from the analysis of an auxiliary Dynkin game. We then fully solve two two-dimensional optimal inventory management problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to establish a connection between multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control and optimal stopping, and to exploit this connection to achieve a complete solution in a genuinely two-dimensional setting.",

We jointly fit 3D bulge and disk models to 2505 galaxies in GOODS-South across seven bands (bvizYJH) to IAB = 25.5, accounting for different component ellipticities and inclination-dependent dust extinction. Extinction strongly affects structural parameters and colour gradients in ~26% of the sample - primarily edge-on galaxies with central obscuration (B-band face-on optical depth tau ~ 4) that reveal clear bulge components in the near-infrared. Despite irregular morphologies, the model captures observed colour gradients well. Bulges at z ~ 1 differ markedly from z ~ 0, with typical Sersic index n ~ 1.0 and bulge-to-disc size ratio Re/hd ~ 0.15, suggesting most galaxies host pseudo-bulges formed via secular evolution. Galaxy ellipticity correlates strongly with disk scale-length and absolute magnitude, partly driven by dust extinction variations. We trace bulge and disk evolution from z ~ 0 to z ~ 2.5: bulges are redder than disks (observed-frame) at z < 1.4, but colours converge at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes. Redder galaxies show redder cores relative to their outskirts, and brighter galaxies have redder cores.",

Although extended CH 3.3 GHz emission is commonly observed in diffuse and translucent clouds, observations in cold, dense clumps are rare. In this work, we conducted high-sensitivity CH observations toward 27 PGCCs with the Arecibo 305m telescope. Toward each source, the CH data were analyzed in conjunction with CO (1--0), HINSA, and H column densities. Our results revealed ubiquitous subsonic velocity dispersions of CH, in contrast to CO, which is predominantly supersonic. The findings suggest that subsonic CH emissions may trace dense, low-turbulent gas structures in PGCCs. To investigate environmental effects, particularly the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA, yielding values from to s ( from to ~cm). This result favors theoretical predictions of a cosmic-ray attenuation model, in which the interstellar spectra of low-energy CR protons and electrons match {\\it Voyager} measurements, although alternative models cannot yet be ruled out. The abundance of CH decreases with increasing column density, while showing a positive dependence on the CRIR, which requires atomic oxygen not heavily depleted to dominate CH destruction in PGCCs. By fitting the abundance of CH with an analytic formula, we place constraints on atomic O abundance ( with respect to total H) and C abundance (). These findings indicate that CH formation is closely linked to the C abundance, regulated by cosmic-ray ionization, while other processes, such as turbulent diffusive transport, might also contribute a non-negligible effect.",

FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation, underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows. However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of traditional software development. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy, alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most time-consuming to resolve. By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.",

Here, we present a classification-based method to select the targets for WAVES-Wide. Rather than estimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign probabilities of them being below , the redshift limit of the subsurvey. This is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes from to and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the classification are the -band and the , and colors. We check the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide limits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude thresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of 94-95\\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close to the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic training sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply the classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million photometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands measured.

While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while , offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications.

In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for and bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs.We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift . While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the boson production could account for approximately of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.",

These strong perturbations may lead to orbital instability, raising questions about the long-term survival of such systems. Shortly after formation, planet-disk interactions can shepherd planets into mean-motion resonances, which may promote long-term stability as seen in HR 8799. However, early-stage processes such as disk photoevaporation and viscosity can influence these outcomes. The 5 Myr-old PDS 70 system offers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive (4 ), wide-orbit (20 AU) giants are still embedded in their natal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the disk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to track the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body simulations. We find that the system is likely to remain stable for 1 Gyr. To assess the importance of disk-driven evolution, we compare these results with disk-free N-body simulations using orbital parameters constrained by orbit fits that include recent relative astrometry and radial velocities from the literature. In this case, we find that only of posterior is stable for 100 Myr, highlighting the importance of considering disk-driven evolution for long-term dynamics stability of exoplanetary systems. We also simulate two three-planet configurations including the proposed inner candidate \"PDS 70 d\", finding that a higher photoevaporation leads the system to become unstable in 10 Myr.",

    "text": "In Paper I, we exploited the unsurpassed resolution and depth of JWST/NIRCam imagery to investigate the relationship between AGN and host-galaxy properties in the JWST era, finding a correlation between the level of spatial disturbance (as measured by shape asymmetry, ) and obscuration (). Here in Paper II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at in the GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.",

Furthermore, these halos are sufficiently compact and dense to gravitationally capture field stars in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, providing a natural explanation for the origin of Fornax 6, a stellar cluster in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

    "text": "Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns. Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE satisfies -secret protection, constituting a relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs, while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE consistently achieves lower Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.",

    "text": "Slitless spectroscopy eliminates the need for slits, allowing light to pass directly through a prism or grism to generate a spectral dispersion image that encompasses all celestial objects within a specified area. This technique enables highly efficient spectral acquisition. However, when processing CSST slitless spectroscopy data, the unique design of its focal plane introduces a challenge: photometric and slitless spectroscopic images do not have a one-to-one correspondence. As a result, it becomes essential to first identify and count the sources in the slitless spectroscopic images before extracting spectra. To address this challenge, we employed the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to develop a model for detecting targets in slitless spectroscopy images. This model was trained on 1,560 simulated CSST slitless spectroscopic images. These simulations were generated from the CSST Cycle 6 and Cycle 9 main survey data products, representing the Galactic and nearby galaxy regions and the high galactic latitude regions, respectively. On the validation set, the model achieved a precision of 88.6% and recall of 90.4% for spectral lines, and 87.0% and 80.8% for zeroth-order images. In testing, it maintained a detection rate >80% for targets brighter than 21 mag (medium-density regions) and 20 mag (low-density regions) in the Galactic and nearby galaxies regions, and >70% for targets brighter than 18 mag in high galactic latitude regions.",

    "text": "The origin and organizing principles of the genetic code remain fundamental puzzles in life science. The vanishingly low probability of the natural codon-to-amino acid mapping arising by chance has spurred the hypothesis that its structure is a solution optimized for robustness against mutations and translational errors. For the construction of effective molecular machines, the dictionary of encoded amino acids must also be diverse enough in physicochemical features. Here, we examine whether the standard genetic code can be understood as a near-optimal solution balancing these two objectives: minimizing error load and aligning codon assignments with the naturally occurring amino acid composition. Using simulated annealing, we explore this trade-off across a broad range of parameters. We find that the standard genetic code lies near local optima within the multidimensional parameter space. It is a highly effective solution that balances fidelity against resource availability constraints. These results suggest that the present genetic code reflects coevolution under conflicting pressures of fidelity and diversity, offering new insight into its emergence and evolution.",

By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay down an agenda for future research in this direction.",

    "text": "The development of an N-body/hydrodynamic `surrogate' model of the Milky Way (MW) - a model that resembles the MW in several key aspects after many Gyrs of evolution - would be extremely beneficial for Galactic Archaeology. Here we present four new `surrogate' models, all built with the Nexus framework. The simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal velocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy. It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible ways forward for future models.",

We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.",

The dynamics are simulated self-consistently with GNC, which we have updated to incorporate gravitational wave orbital decay, the loss cone of a spinning MBH, and stellar evolution. Over Gyr, we investigate the evolution of the NSC with a mass-growing MBH, as well as the EMRIs of stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and low-mass main-sequence stars (MSs), along with tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving MSs, BDs, and post-MSs. The mass growth of the MBH contributed by TDEs is typically , $\\sim 10^6\\,M_{\\odot}\\sim 5\\times10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$ for massive, Milky-Way-like, and smaller NSCs, respectively. Between and of the stellar mass is lost during stellar evolution, which dominates the mass growth of the MBH if a significant fraction of the lost mass is accreted. The evolution of EMRI rates is generally affected by the cluster's size expansion or contraction, stellar population evolution, MBH mass growth, and the stellar initial mass function. The EMRI rates for compact objects peak at early epochs ( Gyr) and then gradually decline over cosmic time. LISA-band ( mHz) EMRIs involving compact objects around Milky-Way-like MBHs tend to have high eccentricities, while those around spinning MBHs preferentially occupy low-inclination (prograde) orbits. In contrast, MS- and BD-EMRIs usually have eccentricity and inclination distributions that are distinct from those of compact objects.",

We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 < z < 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z > 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs -- either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.",

We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 m range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: $A_\\mathrm{F115W} : A_\\mathrm{F162M} : A_\\mathrm{F182M} : A_\\mathrm{F212N} : A_\\mathrm{F360M} : A_\\mathrm{F405N} : A_\\mathrm{F470N} : A_\\mathrm{F480M} = 1.84 \\pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \\pm 0.005 : 0.607 \\pm 0.014 : 0.306 \\pm 0.011 : 0.248 \\pm 0.017 : 0.240 \\pm 0.019 : 0.21 \\pm 0.03$.

Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into the physics governing state transitions in stellar-mass black holes. We discover distinct bimodal flux distributions in the 8-79 keV band with well-separated peaks, contrasting with overlapping distributions in the 3-8 keV band. This energy-dependent bimodality establishes hard X-rays as the optimal diagnostic for state classification, directly tracing the geometric transformation between corona-dominated and disk-dominated configurations. Power spectral analysis uncovers state-dependent characteristic frequencies shifting from 0.050 Hz (hard) to 0.074 Hz (intermediate), with featureless red noise in soft states. These frequencies correspond to disk truncation radii evolving from 5.5 to 2 , providing direct observational evidence for the inward progression of the accretion disk during state transitions. Frequency-dependent time lags evolve systematically from 50 ms hard lags at 0.1 Hz in hard states to near-zero in soft states, quantifying the collapse of the Comptonizing corona. Linear rms-flux relations persist across all states with parameters that precisely track the relative contributions of thermal versus non-thermal emission components. Most remarkably, we identify a failed state transition (observation 30302019006) exhibiting anticorrelated band behavior, suppressed variability ( < 1.38\\%), and apparent sub-ISCO truncation. This discovery challenges standard transition models and suggests new pathways for accretion flow evolution in wind-fed systems.",

Smart NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions and meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our approach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched inductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in tracer evolution. Input data processed through the first 20 vertical levels (from the surface up to 656 hPa) using the ModelE OMA scheme. This vertical range covers nearly the entire BCB concentration distribution in the troposphere, where significant variation on short time horizons due to surface-level emissions is observed. Our evaluation shows excellent model performance with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at the first pressure level. This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa), then gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly. The model maintains acceptable performance even when tested on data from entirely different periods outside the training domain, which is a crucial capability for climate modeling applications requiring reliable long-term projections.",

    "text": "The Chebyshev expansion method is a well-established technique for computing the time evolution of quantum states, particularly in Hermitian systems with a bounded spectrum. Here, we show that the applicability of the Chebyshev expansion method extends well beyond this constraint: It remains valid across the entire complex plane and is thus suitable for arbitrary non-Hermitian matrices. We identify that numerical rounding errors are the primary source of errors encountered when applying the method outside the conventional spectral bounds, and they are not caused by fundamental limitations. By carefully selecting the spectral radius and the time step, we show how these errors can be effectively suppressed, enabling accurate time evolution calculations in non-Hermitian systems. We derive an analytic upper bound for the rounding error, which serves as a practical guideline for selecting time steps in numerical simulations. As an application, we illustrate the performance of the method by computing the time evolution of wave packets in the Hatano-Nelson model.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Optimization via LLM-Guided Objective Evolution for Mobility-on-Demand Systems",
    "text": "Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods, which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free, removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "text": "This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.",

GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with ~mag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH and other key molecular tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed: Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC348, NGC 1333, L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A (North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus, B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis (CrA) East and West; IC5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH emission and dust continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common throughout different star forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the high column density regions displaying subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH velocity dispersion, , and gas kinetic temperature, , vary systematically between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value and spread of and with increasing star formation activity.

Here, we demonstrate a ferroelectric platform with dynamic tunability -- monolayer GeS decorated with transition metal atoms as a proof-of-concept -- where polarization-driven surface electronic reconstruction enables real-time modulation of intermediate binding strength, thereby breaking the Sabatier constraint. Reversible control of hydrogen adsorption allows strong H binding to accelerate the Volmer step, followed by weakened adsorption to promote the Heyrovsky/Tafel step.This dynamic adsorption-desorption decoupling not only surpasses the volcano limit to achieve unprecedented HER activity, but also establishes a general paradigm for designing adaptive electrocatalysts capable of reconfiguring under operating conditions.",

In hybrid oscillator-qubit processors, this compiler invokes generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP) to constructively synthesize arbitrary bosonic phase gates with moderate circuit depth O(log(1/{\\varepsilon})). The approximation cost is scaled by the Fourier bandwidth of the target bosonic phase, rather than by the degree of nonlinearity. Armed with GQSP, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics can be decomposed with arbitrary-phase potential propagators. Compared to fully discrete encodings, our approach avoids the overhead of truncating continuous variables, showing linear dependence on the number of vibration modes while trading success probability for circuit depth. We validate our method on the uracil cation, a canonical system whose accurate modeling requires anharmonic vibronic models, estimating the cost for state preparation and time evolution.",

Identifying which reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the overall change in latent representations between the start and end of reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average. Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace, enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.",

    "text": "This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.",

    "text": "Dark gaps, low surface brightness regions along the bar minor axis, are expected to form as a consequence of secular evolution in barred galaxies. Although several studies have proposed links between dark gap locations and dynamical resonances, the results remain inconclusive. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Survey data, we find that approximately 61% of barred galaxies exhibit pronounced dark gaps. We compare the location of dark gaps with resonance radii derived from the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to MaNGA data for the same galaxies. Our analysis shows that dark gaps do not preferentially form at specific resonances. Instead, their locations correlate with : slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while fast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar length and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by their ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific resonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are closely associated with the corotation radius. In galaxies with two dark gaps along the bar minor axis profile, the inner dark gap typically aligns with the ultraharmonic resonance, and the outer dark gap corresponds to the corotation radius. These findings suggest that some morphological types share similar values and exhibit dark gaps near specific resonances. Thus, dark gaps may serve as proxies for dynamical resonances only in certain systems. Our findings may help explain the discrepancies observed in earlier studies.",

For a steady state which is pure, this protocol can function as an autonomous qubit reset. We can also choose a mixed steady state so that this functions as a tunable mixed-state preparation. With a particular dissipative condition, we guarantee the equilibration to the steady-state with spectral measure theory.

This unique technique allows us to measure both star formation rates and dust extinction for a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that dust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H/H ratio), increases with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies, whereas relatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among galaxies with intermediate masses (), the dust-corrected H-based star formation rates align with the main sequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this relation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density environments. Although stellar mass, SFR, and galaxy color are clearly influenced by environment, we detect no strong, systematic environmental dependence of dust extinction for the whole sample.",

In this paper we investigate whether metallicities derived from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra can be effectively used to break degeneracies and improve the accuracy of OC parameter determinations. We analysed 20 OCs using isochrone fitting methods on Gaia DR3 photometry and metallicity estimates from several Gaia XP-based catalogues. We derived age, distance modulus, and extinction using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). We compared the parameter estimates to the values obtained in other works through isochrone fitting with spectroscopically constrained metallicities or through neural network techniques applied only to the photometry. We found the systematic difference between Gaia XP derived metallicities and those obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to be 0.1-0.15 dex. We found a systematic age difference of <0.03 +- 0.13 dex compared to isochrone fitting using high-resolution spectroscopy, and <0.08 +- 0.21 dex compared to neural network-based methods, and a median individual error of ~0.065 dex. Despite their low resolution, Gaia XP metallicities effectively constrain parameters of clusters lacking a well-populated RGB. When used with stringent quality cuts and incorporated as priors, they allow to determine ages comparable in precision to those based on high-resolution spectroscopy and more precise than photometry-only neural network methods.

Studies comparing those type II AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes, disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and models of the host's spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships to the AGN and the host galaxy at incredible spatial-resolution down to about 20pc at z=2.801.",

    "text": "The multi-dimensional six-wave interaction system is derived in the context of nonlinear optics. Starting from Maxwell's equations, a reduced system of equations governing the dynamics of the electric and polarization fields are obtained. Using a space-time multi-scale asymptotic expansion, a hierarchy of coupled equations describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the perturbed electric and polarization fields are derived. The leading order equation admits a six-wave ansatz satisfying a triad resonance condition. By removing secular terms at next order, a first order in space and time quadratically nonlinear coupled six-wave interaction system is obtained. This resulting system is tied to its integrable counterpart which was postulated by Ablowitz and Haberman in the 1970s. A reduction to a space-time shifted nonlocal three-wave system is presented. The resulting system is solved using the inverse scattering transform, which employs nonlocal symmetries between the associated eigenfunctions and scattering data; soliton solutions are then obtained. Finally, an infinite set of conservation laws for the six-wave system is derived; one is shown to be connected to its Hamiltonian structure.",

    "text": "The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.",

    "text": "Multiple structures within stellar groups are an intriguing subject for theoretical and observational studies of stellar formation. With the accuracy and completeness of data from Gaia Data Release 3, we now have new opportunities to detect reliable members of stellar groups across a larger field of view than in previous studies. In this work, using machine learning methods and high-accuracy data, we investigate the possibility of detecting multiple structures within 500 arcmin of ASCC 32. We first applied DBSCAN to proper motion and parallax, as multiple structures tend to share similar values for these parameters. Next, we applied GMM to position, proper motion, and parallax for the members detected by DBSCAN. This approach allowed us to identify a filamentary structure among the DBSCAN-detected members. This structure contains all stellar groups previously identified in this region. Subsequently, based on the BIC score, we applied GMM to this filamentary structure. Since multiple structures exhibit distinct positional distributions, GMM was able to effectively separate all groups within the filament. Our methods successfully identified ASCC 32, OC 0395, and HSC 1865 within a 500 arcmin radius. Additionally, we found two distinct substructures within ASCC 32. These four groups exhibit a single main-sequence distribution in the CMD, with proper motion values within three times the standard deviation and slightly differing parallax values, despite having distinct spatial structures. Furthermore, these four groups share the same radial velocity distribution. We provide documentation demonstrating the formation of these stellar groups as a multiple structure, with improved membership identification compared to previous studies.",

For pointlike sources we extend the parametrized post-Newtonian lensing framework to fourth order, whereas for extended sources we develop a ray tracing approach via a simple radiative transfer model. Modelling non-relativistic proper motion of the lens in front of a background star we record the apparent brightness as a function of time, resulting in a photometric lightcurve. Taking the star radius to smaller values, our numerical results approach the theoretical predictions for point-like sources. Compared to the Schwarzschild metric in an otherwise unmodified lensing geometry, we find that non-singular black hole models (and their horizonless, non-singular counterparts) at finite size tend to feature larger magnifications in microlensing lightcurves, contrary to the point-source prediction.",

Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.",

Despite the early efforts, a complete understanding of the micromagnetic evolution of the width and the type of magnetic domain walls has still remained missing. Here, we report a combined analytical and micromagnetic simulation study and establish the scaling of the magnetic domains as a function of the exchange stiffness (A), uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (Ku), saturation magnetization (Ms), and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and shape anisotropy of the magnetic device. We find that the width of both Bloch and Neel walls scales excellently with the analytical prediction. The DMI is found to have little influence on the domain wall width but strongly affect the type of the domain wall. The domain wall has a Bloch configuration at zero DMI and gradually transitions to Neel configuration upon increase of the DMI. The shape anisotropy of the magnetic domain wall also affects the domain wall width. These results have established a comprehensive, conclusive understanding of the magnetic domain walls within spintronics devices.",

These deep optical images were obtained with the DECam camera (CTIO) and reach down to a surface brightness limit of $\\mu( 3\\sigma;10''\\times10'')\\rm arcsec^2$ in the g band. We also report the HI properties for 89 cluster members detected with MeerKAT. A color magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a bimodal distribution typical of a cluster population, more evolved than those found in isolation. We combine optical H and WISE infrared data to compare the star formation history at two distinct timescales. Differences in the star forming activity depicted by both populations manifest as starburst in 24 found members. Of these, 18 starburst galaxies have neutral gas measurements, and show disturbed HI disks that suggest an environmentally-triggered boost in star formation within the last 10 yrs. Processes such as ram pressure stripping or tidal interactions may underlie their enhanced star-forming activity and asymmetric disks. Since Hydra's dynamical history is unclear, we examine the spatial and velocity distribution of the sample. We reveal a possible link between the large scale structure feeding the Hydra I cluster and the heightened star-forming activity of the starburst galaxies. This feeding pattern matches the few substructure that has been identified in Hydra in previous works, and may explain its origin. Our results portray a picture of a cluster with an evolved nature, plus a population of new infalling galaxies that manifest the impact of their first contact with the cluster environment through star formation, color, morphology and gas content transformations.",

    "title": "Distributionally Robust Control with End-to-End Statistically Guaranteed Metric Learning",
    "text": "Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems. However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate. Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness compared against state-of-the-art methods.",

    "text": "The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a new paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities, enabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional phase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device implementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of correlated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational adaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2) serves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT functionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the lattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane tensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply altering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over a wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive the structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence, which is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier delocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present work establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in correlated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic electronic phases and physical phenomena.",

    "title": "ReMix: Towards a Unified View of Consistent Character Generation and Editing",
    "text": "Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1) have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts, pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an {\\epsilon}-equivariant latent space that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.",

Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices.",

In this work, we aim at a self-contained and accessible presentation of these approaches to further elaborate on their common roots in essential concepts of stochastic calculus and to delineate the conditions under which they are equivalent. We also discuss how different formulations naturally lead to different numerical time-integration schemes, better suited for either classical simulation platforms, based on finite-difference approximations, or quantum algorithms, that employ random unitary maps.

In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces.

Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] > -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] > -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] < -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.",
