    "summary": "At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies\nis in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z >= 2. Only one such galaxy currently\nexists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst\nArc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec\nintegral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of\nthe source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM\nkinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We find that\nthe galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of\nturbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The\ncluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or\ndust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that\nphotoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape.\nWe conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have\nremoved a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster,\nmaking it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.",

Carina IV ($M_V = -2.8;\\ r_{1/2} =\n40 {\\rm pc}$) and Phoenix III ($M_V = -1.2;\\ r_{1/2} = 19 {\\rm pc}$) have\nhalf-light radii that are consistent with the known population of dwarf\ngalaxies, while DELVE 7 ($M_V = 1.2;\\ r_{1/2} = 2 {\\rm pc}$) is very compact\nand seems more likely to be a star cluster, though its nature remains ambiguous\nwithout spectroscopic followup. The Gaia proper motions of stars in Carina IV\n($M_* = 2250^{+1180}_{-830} {\\rm M_\\odot}$) indicate that it is unlikely to be\nassociated with the LMC, while DECam CaHK photometry confirms that its member\nstars are metal-poor.

Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states,\nwe find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time\nperiod when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the\ninitial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is\nstrongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest\ngrowth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational\nbasis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime,\nrevealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during\nthermalization.

    "summary": "In difference-in-differences (DiD) settings with categorical outcomes,\ntreatment effects often operate on both total quantities (e.g., voter turnout)\nand category shares (e.g., vote distribution across parties). In this context,\nlinear DiD models can be problematic: they suffer from scale dependence, may\nproduce negative counterfactual quantities, and are inconsistent with discrete\nchoice theory. We propose compositional DiD (CoDiD), a new method that\nidentifies counterfactual categorical quantities, and thus total levels and\nshares, under a parallel growths assumption. The assumption states that, absent\ntreatment, each category's size grows or shrinks at the same proportional rate\nin treated and control groups. In a random utility framework, we show that this\nimplies parallel evolution of relative preferences between any pair of\ncategories. Analytically, we show that it also means the shares are reallocated\nin the same way in both groups in the absence of treatment. Finally,\ngeometrically, it corresponds to parallel trajectories (or movements) of\nprobability mass functions of the two groups in the probability simplex under\nAitchison geometry. We extend CoDiD to i) derive bounds under relaxed\nassumptions, ii) handle staggered adoption, and iii) propose a synthetic DiD\nanalog. We illustrate the method's empirical relevance through two\napplications: first, we examine how early voting reforms affect voter choice in\nU.S. presidential elections; second, we analyze how the Regional Greenhouse Gas\nInitiative (RGGI) affected the composition of electricity generation across\nsources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables.",

These were\nused to calculate reduced transition probabilities, spectroscopic quadrupole\nmoments, and rotational invariant shape parameters, providing enhanced\nprecision and expanding on previous studies. The experimental data were\ncompared within several theoretical frameworks, including the generalized\ntriaxial rotor model, configuration interaction shell-model calculations, and\ncomputations within the combined frameworks of relativistic density functional\ntheory and the five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate\na good agreement with the experimental data and, in conjunction with\ncalculations using a two-state mixing model, support significant triaxiality\nand strong mixing between the $0^+_1$ and $0^+_2$ states.

We critically assess these claims by\nperforming $N$-body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes\". We\nsimulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as\nstudying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context.\nThese simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial\nrole and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits\non the steepness $\\gamma$ of DM density profiles required to explain the period\ndecay in these LMXBs, requiring $\\gamma \\gtrsim 2.15-2.20$ in XTE J1118+480 and\nA0620--00 and $\\gamma \\gtrsim 2.3$ in Nova Muscae 1991.

Our extended model is calibrated using two\ncomplementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves\nindividual Population III and II stars to $z\\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which\nis lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z\n\\sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of\nprimordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good\nagreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in\nnumber of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement\nrequires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence\nof, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold\n$M_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death\nand subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos\nthat have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay\nin simulations limits physically motivated calibrations.

In a single\nconfiguration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint\n(F444W<30 mag) z$_{\\rm phot}$>3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising\nemission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6\nand 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850\nsources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over\n2.5<z<8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than\nstandard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (<200 sources), with no loss in\nredshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at\nfixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but\nthe gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty.\nThe measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5\n(i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\\lambda$~4 $\\mu$m, demonstrating that\ncontrolled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for\nlarge samples.

We derive Balmer-line based SFRs,\ngas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line\ncalibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line\nAGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables\nrobust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain\nlarge samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground\nbetween the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth\nof NIRSpec/MSA.",

The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH\nemission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and\nionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local\nradiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z < 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs\nremains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed\nformation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS\nobservations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We\nconfirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and,\nfor the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region\nnearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the\ngalaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature\nis clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically\nbrighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral\nmolecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR\nline ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a\ncombination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing\n4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can\nproduce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations\nof similar galaxies.

    "summary": "The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method\noriginally proposed for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, in which cell\naverages and point values at cell interfaces are evolved simultaneously. This\npaper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic\nproblems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta\n(SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a\ndegenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the\nderivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin\n(LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations\nwithin a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The\nevolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring\nconservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables\nare updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete\nFourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order\nSSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is $0.27$ in 1D, as\nobtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed\nmethod is further applied to the porous medium equation, and\npositivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the\nnon-negativity of the numerical solutions. Several numerical experiments\nvalidate the theoretical results and efficacy of the method.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAR) is a recent evolution of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that employs multiple reasoning steps for\nretrieval and generation. While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains\nvulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\noffers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,\nhowever, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step\nretrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for\nRAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising\nfrom retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources\nand introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ\nmethod for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning\nprocess by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations\nalter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies\nthe generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,\nthe retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling\nus to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five\npopular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by\nover 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines. Extrinsic\nevaluations using R2C as an external signal further confirm its effectiveness\nfor two downstream tasks: in Abstention, it achieves ~5% gains in both\nF1Abstain and AccAbstain; in Model Selection, it improves the exact match by\n~7% over single models and ~3% over selection methods.",

In this work, we\npropose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function\nin the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions,\ncan systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each\nwith bond dimension $2$.

However, the saturation of ice bands in highly\ninclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical\nspectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly\nabundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it\nmodifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and\nexoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance\nwithin disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the\napparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and\nquantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that\nthe increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in\nthe adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to\nthe abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of\nedge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James\nWebb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models\nand observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except\nacross the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced\nacross the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases\nwith ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates\nthe presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation\nthat this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this\nmethod, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly\ninclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this\nmethod is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and\napplicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.",

Moreover, it is predicted\nthat for an isothermal elliptical potential the source position both lies on\nWitt's Hyperbola and coincides with the center of Wynne's Ellipse (fitted\nthrough the four images). Thus, by fitting Witt's Hyperbolae to several\nquartets of images - ten are known in Abell 1689 - the points of intersection\nprovide an estimate for the center for the assumed isothermal elliptical\npotential. We introduce a new figure of merit defined by the offset of the\ncenter of Wynne's Ellipse from Witt's Hyperbola. This offset quantifies\ndeviations from an ideal elliptical isothermal potential and serves as a\ndiscriminant to exclude poorly fitted quadruples and assign greater weight to\nintersections of hyperbolae of better fitting systems. Applying the method to\n10 quads (after excluding 7 poorly fitted quads) in Abell 1689, we find the\npotential is centered within 11\" of the BCG, X-ray center, flexion-based center\nand the center found from a total strong lensing analysis.

No correlation is found\nbetween DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the\nREBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a\nstrong correlation between $A_{\\mathrm{V}}/N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ and metallicity.\nThese findings suggest that by $z\\sim7$ massive galaxies can already host\nsubstantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with\n$A_{\\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the\nhighest redshifts ($z>8$), however, we see tentative evidence for\nsystematically lower $A_{\\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ at fixed metallicity,\nwhich may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust\ndestruction/expulsion.",

Existing generative\nparadigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing\ne-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is\nconstrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm.

However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical\nobjective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve\nthis via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages\nthrough cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment\nModule for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative\nmodel with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture\ntemporal causality.

The chemical and dynamical\nstructure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major\naccretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day\norbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the\nmerging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological\nzoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages,\nand present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that\nstars born in the progenitor's core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and\nchemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and\nmetal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Sk\\'ulad\\'ottir et al.\n(2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context.\nThe preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as\n[Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The\nmedian abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar,\nthough less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported\nby Sk\\'ulad\\'ottir et al.

This provides an incentive to examine the physics of\nHD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation\nby collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD\nformation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art\nPDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can\nbe used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting\nregion. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon\nPDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and\nsynthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in\nthe gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and\nthat the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2\ntransition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the\nobservations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2\ndissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2\npeaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We\nderive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high\ncontinuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 $\\mu$m,\nno pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows\nthat a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10$^7$ K cm$^{-3}$ with no strong\nconstraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD\nobservations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from\nH2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD\nemission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal\npressure in the PDR.",

In this work, we conducted high-sensitivity CH\nobservations toward 27 PGCCs with the Arecibo 305m telescope. Toward each\nsource, the CH data were analyzed in conjunction with $^{13}$CO (1--0), HINSA,\nand H$_2$ column densities. Our results revealed ubiquitous subsonic velocity\ndispersions of CH, in contrast to $^{13}$CO, which is predominantly supersonic.\nThe findings suggest that subsonic CH emissions may trace dense, low-turbulent\ngas structures in PGCCs. To investigate environmental effects, particularly the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA,\nyielding values from $(8.1\\pm4.7)\\times10^{-18}$ to $(2.0\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-16}$\ns$^{-1}$ ($N_{H_2}$ from $(1.7\\pm0.2)\\times10^{21}$ to\n$(3.6\\pm0.4)\\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$). This result favors theoretical\npredictions of a cosmic-ray attenuation model, in which the interstellar\nspectra of low-energy CR protons and electrons match {\\it Voyager}\nmeasurements, although alternative models cannot yet be ruled out. The\nabundance of CH decreases with increasing column density, while showing a\npositive dependence on the CRIR, which requires atomic oxygen not heavily\ndepleted to dominate CH destruction in PGCCs. By fitting the abundance of CH\nwith an analytic formula, we place constraints on atomic O abundance\n($2.4\\pm0.4\\times10^{-4}$ with respect to total H) and C$^+$ abundance\n($7.4\\pm0.7\\times10^{13}\\zeta_2/n_{\\rm H_2}$).

Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes\nfrom $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the\nclassification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We\ncheck the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide\nlimits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude\nthresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of\n94-95\\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close\nto the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic\ntraining sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply\nthe classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million\nphotometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands\nmeasured.

    "summary": "End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs\nto future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional\nmodular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often\noperate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene\ncontext, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their\ntemporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make\ninformed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new\nperspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely\nintertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the\nvehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.\nMotivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel\nend-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory\nplanning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,\nthen leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.\nTwo key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects\npredicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene\nmodeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and\ntrajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments\non the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on\ngradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently\nunsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on\nbackpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives\naddress these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack\nflexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge\ndevices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the\nprincipal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution\nstrategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only\nenhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to\nthe source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is\nachieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and\nenabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and\ncomputational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword\nspotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets\ndemonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while\n$\\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a\npractical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications.

Therefore,\nthese astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy\nelectron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$\nbosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron\nannihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the\nresonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to\nthe diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of\nthe FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for\n$W^{\\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the\ncosmological population of FSRQs.We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function\nand its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across\ncosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a\npronounced peak at redshift $z \\sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well\nbelow the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as\nIceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production\ncould account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical\nneutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of\nStandard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and\nemphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating\nthat even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable\nimprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.",

The $\\sim$5 Myr-old PDS 70 system\noffers a unique laboratory to investigate these processes: its two massive\n($>$4 $M_{Jup}$), wide-orbit ($>$20 AU) giants are still embedded in their\nnatal disk. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the system, allowing the\ndisk to disperse via photoevaporation. Once the disk dissipates, we continue to\ntrack the planets' orbital evolution over Gyr timescales using N-body\nsimulations.

Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal\nvelocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function\nof Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy.\nIt is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it\ndoes not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which\nis difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered\nrotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our\nmodels are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated\nwith our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in\nthe inner gas disc.

We determined\nextinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the\nreddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties\nare well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve\nderived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the\nliterature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M:\n$A_\\mathrm{F115W} : A_\\mathrm{F162M} : A_\\mathrm{F182M} : A_\\mathrm{F212N} :\nA_\\mathrm{F360M} : A_\\mathrm{F405N} : A_\\mathrm{F470N} : A_\\mathrm{F480M} =\n1.84 \\pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \\pm 0.005 : 0.607 \\pm 0.014 : 0.306 \\pm 0.011 :\n0.248 \\pm 0.017 : 0.240 \\pm 0.019 : 0.21 \\pm 0.03$.

Our analysis reveals fundamental insights into the physics\ngoverning state transitions in stellar-mass black holes. We discover distinct\nbimodal flux distributions in the 8-79 keV band with well-separated peaks,\ncontrasting with overlapping distributions in the 3-8 keV band. This\nenergy-dependent bimodality establishes hard X-rays as the optimal diagnostic\nfor state classification, directly tracing the geometric transformation between\ncorona-dominated and disk-dominated configurations. Power spectral analysis\nuncovers state-dependent characteristic frequencies shifting from 0.050 Hz\n(hard) to 0.074 Hz (intermediate), with featureless red noise in soft states.\nThese frequencies correspond to disk truncation radii evolving from $\\sim$5.5\n$R_g$ to $\\sim$2 $R_g$, providing direct observational evidence for the inward\nprogression of the accretion disk during state transitions. Frequency-dependent\ntime lags evolve systematically from $\\sim$50 ms hard lags at 0.1 Hz in hard\nstates to near-zero in soft states, quantifying the collapse of the\nComptonizing corona. Linear rms-flux relations persist across all states with\nparameters that precisely track the relative contributions of thermal versus\nnon-thermal emission components. Most remarkably, we identify a failed state\ntransition (observation 30302019006) exhibiting anticorrelated band behavior,\nsuppressed variability ($F_{var}$ < 1.38\\%), and apparent sub-ISCO truncation.\nThis discovery challenges standard transition models and suggests new pathways\nfor accretion flow evolution in wind-fed systems.",

This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications.",

ESMs like NASA GISS-ModelE3\n(ModelE) often use pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition\nconcentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs.\nWhile NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time\nfeedback between aerosols and other climate processes by relying on\npre-calculated fields.

Smart\nNINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions\nand meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our\napproach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched\ninductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in\ntracer evolution.

This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa),\nthen gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly.

Existing methods typically fall into two\ncategories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data\ninefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty\nenforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,\nwhich rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of\nlow-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid\nframework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical\noptimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,\nremoving the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it\nleverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition\nby adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM\nserves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a\nlow-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time\ndecision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop\nevolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the\nLLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization\nlayer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York\nand Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nachieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

These components allow the model to adjust\nthe importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic\nvariations across different periods. The temporal representations are then\nmapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to\ndescribe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective\nconstrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity\nand smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling\nof semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic\ncoherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over\ntime. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively\ncaptures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms\nexisting models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides\na systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in\nlarge-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and\nsupports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages\ncompact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable\nhigh-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The\nframework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated\nsplatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar\nappearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to\ncapture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations.\nThis decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy,\nenabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the\nsequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters,\nconsisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal\nbit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming\ncanonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating\ntemporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms\nconventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting\ncompression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream\nmulti-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive\nmultimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.",

A cosmologically viable form of $f(T)$ is\nchosen (where $T$ is the torsion scalar in teleparallelism) in the background\nof homogenous and anisotropic. For our model, we take $f(T) = T+\\zeta T^{2}$\nwhere $\\zeta$ is a constant. The evolution equations are reduced to the\nautonomous system of differential equations by suitable transformation of\nvariables. The behaviour of the equilibrium points is examined by calculating\nthe eigenvalues corresponding to these equilibrium points. We get four\nequilibrium points for our cosmological model out of which one equilibrium\npoint is stable, two are saddle points and one is an unstable equilibrium\npoint. Corresponding to equilibrium point $T_{2}$, our model is consistent with\nthe quintessence dark energy cosmological model. Along the equilibrium points\n$T_{1},T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$, our model is consistent to phantom dark energy\nmodel. After that, we utilize the autonomous equations to analyse the\ncosmographic parameters along with the state-finder parameter. We demonstrate\nthe phase plot analysis for our model.",

    "summary": "Dark gaps, low surface brightness regions along the bar minor axis, are\nexpected to form as a consequence of secular evolution in barred galaxies.\nAlthough several studies have proposed links between dark gap locations and\ndynamical resonances, the results remain inconclusive. Using DESI Legacy\nImaging Survey data, we find that approximately 61% of barred galaxies exhibit\npronounced dark gaps. We compare the location of dark gaps with resonance radii\nderived from the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to MaNGA data for the same\ngalaxies. Our analysis shows that dark gaps do not preferentially form at\nspecific resonances. Instead, their locations correlate with $\\mathcal{R}$\n$\\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while\nfast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar\nlength and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by\ntheir ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific\nresonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are\nclosely associated with the corotation radius. In galaxies with two dark gaps\nalong the bar minor axis profile, the inner dark gap typically aligns with the\nultraharmonic resonance, and the outer dark gap corresponds to the corotation\nradius. These findings suggest that some morphological types share similar\n$\\mathcal{R}$ values and exhibit dark gaps near specific resonances. Thus, dark\ngaps may serve as proxies for dynamical resonances only in certain systems. Our\nfindings may help explain the discrepancies observed in earlier studies.",

This unique\ntechnique allows us to measure both star formation rates and dust extinction\nfor a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that\ndust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$\nratio), increases with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies, whereas\nrelatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among\ngalaxies with intermediate masses ($10^{8.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}\\,M_\\odot$), the\ndust-corrected H$\\alpha$-based star formation rates align with the main\nsequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this\nrelation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density\nenvironments.

We derived age,\ndistance modulus, and extinction using the Approximate Bayesian Computation\n(ABC).\n  We compared the parameter estimates to the values obtained in other works\nthrough isochrone fitting with spectroscopically constrained metallicities or\nthrough neural network techniques applied only to the photometry. We found the\nsystematic difference between Gaia XP derived metallicities and those obtained\nfrom high-resolution spectroscopy to be 0.1-0.15 dex. We found a systematic age\ndifference of <0.03 +- 0.13 dex compared to isochrone fitting using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, and <0.08 +- 0.21 dex compared to neural\nnetwork-based methods, and a median individual error of ~0.065 dex.\n  Despite their low resolution, Gaia XP metallicities effectively constrain\nparameters of clusters lacking a well-populated RGB. When used with stringent\nquality cuts and incorporated as priors, they allow to determine ages\ncomparable in precision to those based on high-resolution spectroscopy and more\nprecise than photometry-only neural network methods.

Studies comparing those type II\nAGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an\nevolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes,\ndisturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of\nangular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking\nAGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material\nenshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback\nclears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and\nalso quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of\nintermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and\ndusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their\nstar-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the\ntime of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of\nSDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801.

In this work, using machine learning\nmethods and high-accuracy data, we investigate the possibility of detecting\nmultiple structures within 500 arcmin of ASCC 32. We first applied DBSCAN to\nproper motion and parallax, as multiple structures tend to share similar values\nfor these parameters.

This\nstructure contains all stellar groups previously identified in this region.\nSubsequently, based on the BIC score, we applied GMM to this filamentary\nstructure. Since multiple structures exhibit distinct positional distributions,\nGMM was able to effectively separate all groups within the filament. Our\nmethods successfully identified ASCC 32, OC 0395, and HSC 1865 within a 500\narcmin radius. Additionally, we found two distinct substructures within ASCC\n32.

    "summary": "Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a\nprincipled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems.\nHowever, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution\nshifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control\nsynthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control\nobjectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably\nleads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC\nframework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with\ndownstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets\nto be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and\nyielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a\nbilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under\nDRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging\ncontrol-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve\nthis program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian\nalgorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the\nlearned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a\nnovel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the\nbilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the\nlearnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to\nstationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically\nconsistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate.\nExperiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the\nproposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness\ncompared against state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a\nnew paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities,\nenabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional\nphase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device\nimplementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of\ncorrelated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational\nadaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2)\nserves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT\nfunctionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the\nlattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane\ntensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply\naltering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over\na wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive\nthe structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence,\nwhich is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier\ndelocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present\nwork establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in\ncorrelated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic\nelectronic phases and physical phenomena.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)\nhave greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and\nediting. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single\nframework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity\nconsistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial\ncontrollability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose\nReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It\nconstitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix\nModule leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic\nfeatures of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT\nbackbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,\npixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address\nthis, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues\nfrom reference images and introduces an {\\epsilon}-equivariant latent space\nthat jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise\nspace. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where\nenvironmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature\nalignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while\npreserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including\npersonalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition\nsynthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a\nunified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.",

    "summary": "Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to\nphase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main\nclasses of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i)\ntransversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined\nlongitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract in space, and (ii) 2D-localized\nspatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted)\nOAM and propagate/diffract in both space and time. Here we introduce another\nclass of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in\nspace (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract\nsolely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can\nnaturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves.\nWe provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices,\ntheir underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave\nsolutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the\nrotational evolution in such vortices.",

We determine precise\nages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a\nmean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the\nframework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of\nplanet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] > -0.2)\nof the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk.\nBased on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these\nyoung hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to\nthe solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be\nmore metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] > -0.2. This suggests\nthat both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively\nmetal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] < -0.2, we find\nthat their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to\nnon-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to\nbe the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments.\nWe also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially\ncarbon, in planet hosts.
