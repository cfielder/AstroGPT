    "summary": "Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter,\nand the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for\nunparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to\nthe precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of\nthe entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly\nlensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos:\n\\emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative\nmagnification ($\\mu_r > 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the\ncaustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for\n$\\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models,\nand \\emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images,\nwhich occur for $\\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find\nthat these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in\nour simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of\nlow-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in\nlensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction\nintegral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We\nalso report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the\ndistributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo\npopulations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the\nupcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based\ndetectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide\ninsight into the nature of dark matter.",

In this paper, we present X-ray\nobservations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG\nspace observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized\nby a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray\nemission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the\nthermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs,\nrepresented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\\gtrsim\n100\\,{\\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a\npair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the\norbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are\nprominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted\npicture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding\nmedium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and\ndedicated numerical simulations.",

    "summary": "The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the\nMilky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the\nupcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of\nknown streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of\nindividual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality\nand quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation\nthat GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold\nfor all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with\nthe progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a\nsubset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and\ncompleteness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream\ndetection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual\nexpectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in\nthe multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters\nto account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog\ntailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and\ncompleteness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 degree.",

The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray\nspectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and\nhadron-dominated phases.

Moreover, we perform an analysis of a\nsimulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time\n(LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter\nconstraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator.

We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses\nusing physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance\nthrough Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores.

Due to\nconvection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular\nvariations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM\naround the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady\nwind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface\nconvection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need\nto be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based\non our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used\nfor SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN\n2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among\nmost hydrogen-rich SNe.

    "summary": "Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed\nmultiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which\noften fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds.\nWe present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows\ninteracting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its\ncold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\\rm ISM}$, and clump size\n$r_{\\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\\rm ISM}\n\\gtrsim r_{\\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition\n($r_{\\rm cl} > r_{\\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across\ndiverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\\rm cl}/r_{\\rm\ncrit} \\sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the\ninitial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum\nfollowing Zipf's law ($\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}m \\propto m^{-2}$), implying that\nturbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase\noutflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\\sim \\chi\nr_{\\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The\ninteraction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both\nphases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov\nscaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions\nreach $\\sigma \\sim c_{\\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas\napproaches unity even for $f_v \\sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling\nfraction stays low, explaining the \"misty\" appearance of observed outflows.\nTogether, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to\ngalaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting\nobservations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale\nsimulations.",

Comparison with a large\nliterature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich\nsources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly\nmore sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first\ntime and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the\nCO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2). The majority (82%) of detected lines\nconform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double\nwind.

Yet, these low-mass\nstars can emit high-energy radiation that may gradually erode planetary\natmospheres, raising concerns about long-term habitability. TOI-700, a\nrelatively quiescent M dwarf that hosts four known planets, stands out due to\nits Earth-sized TOI-700 d in the star's habitable zone. Here, we assess whether\na habitable environment can be sustained on TOI-700 d by analyzing different UV\nflux levels and atmospheric pressures. We focus on two atmospheric scenarios -\none analogous to the Archean Earth and another representing a modern Earth-like\nenvironment - using a 1D photochemistry-climate model. Our results indicate\nthat all simulated cases can maintain temperatures compatible with liquid water\non the surface. However, the dominant photochemical pathways differ\nsubstantially with UV levels: under low-UV conditions, haze formation in the\nArchean-like atmosphere provides the main UV shielding, whereas under\nintensified UV, ozone production in the modern-like atmospheres can protect the\nsurface from harmful doses. Interestingly, although haze can impede the\ndetection of certain biosignatures, such as CH4, CO2 and O2, it also enhances\nthe overall atmospheric signal by increasing scattering and transit depth,\npotentially aiding in revealing the presence of an atmosphere. These findings\nunderscore the dual role of hazes as both a challenge for biosignature\ndetection and a potential protection of surface habitability.",

In particular, radio continuum (RC)\nobservations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a\nsignificant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the\ndetectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15\ndwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs)\nspanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using\nmulti-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact\nArray, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and\nexplore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is\ndetected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission\ncorrelates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass,\nwhile dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no\nsignificant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that\nthe RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a\nsimple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more\ncomplex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms\nthat a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral\nshapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches.\nAdditionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic\nray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can\nescape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.",

Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old\nstellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the\nold stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of\nmetal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The\nyoung stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all\ngalaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar.\nPreviously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar\nage on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the\naverage over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include\ncontributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of\nthe four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population\nsynthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust\nlanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of\ninterstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone.

Current theoretical\nmodels do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which\nintroduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study\nthe hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the\nsynchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with\nnon-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are\nexplored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a\nGalactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance\nof 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early\ntimes and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of\nthe high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline\npattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are\nclearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred\nfrom radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly\nfrom those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those\nfrom simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.",

This\nenables accurate density estimation within groups and flexible borrowing across\ngroups, overcoming the density-clustering trade-off of previous approaches.

    "summary": "Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy\nevolution. Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the\nactivity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of\nthe host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of\noutflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately\nconstant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\\rm\ntr} \\sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven\noutflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to\nexpand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical\ncode to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a\nconstant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite\nbulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free\nparameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles,\nvariations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of\noutflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles\nessentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density\nprofile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves\nthe fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they\naccelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of\nsignificant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of\noutflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can\nexplain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The\nfree parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable\nranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the\ntrue conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion.",

X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show\ndramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The\npower spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law\nthat decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high\nfrequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the\nmass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the\n`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly\nsampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous\npaper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power\nlaw power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56\nvariable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the\n$0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends\nin 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We\nalso find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We\nupdate the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements\nspanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends\nin the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H\n1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.",

We quantify the relative\nimprovement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three\ncluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed\npriors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable\nrelation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i)\nthere are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For\ncurrent knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the\naddition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy\nequation of state, $\\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\\pm\n0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering\ninformation is more important for the matter density, with $\\sigma(\\Omega_M)$\nreduced by factors of $1.068 \\pm 007$ to $1.145 \\pm 0.012$. The improvement in\n$w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after\ntightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For\nweaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the\ncluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \\pm 0.041$ and\n$1.340 \\pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the\nanticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys,\nself-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent\ncross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable\nrelationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster\ncosmology.",

A crucial step forward is that of estimating\nthe fraction of missing baryons in the halos, but it relies on understanding\nthe real cause of the observed CMB temperature asymmetry since many effects\nmight give a non-negligible contribution. Here, we analyzed the contribution\nplayed by the anomalous microwave emission (AME) from halo dust grains in the\nhalo of the M 31 galaxy. Assuming either amorphous carbon and silicates dust\ngrains with size ranging from $0.01~\\mu$m to about $0.3~\\mu$m and mass in the\nrange $10^{-14} - 10^{-13}$ g, we estimated the total mass, distribution, and\ndiffuse emission in the $100\\,\\mu$m band of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite\n(IRAS).

To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method\nbased on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the\npreviously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective\nmitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust\nstructures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate\nextinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying\nXPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey,\nwe have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that\nspan roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l <\n232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and\n300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers\nhigher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions\ncompared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane,\nproviding an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.",

Here, a simple method is proposed to\nsupport optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent\noptical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are\nexpected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be\nnon-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN.\nThrough simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by\nContinuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar\nas time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely\nsmaller than $3.3\\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding\noptical color evolutions, but about $3.1\\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with\nperiodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the\nsimulated single-band light curves.

    "summary": "AGN feedback is a well known mechanism in the evolution of galaxies. One open\nquestion is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift,\nradio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving\nionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies\nhave investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our\nmain goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with\nmoderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in\nobservations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed\nin earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at\ncomparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the\nliterature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure\nin our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649\naligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a\njet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we\nfound that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial\nscales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas\npresent small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that\nthe kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by\noutflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and\nionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic\nconsiderations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a\nsignificant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low\nredshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot\nrule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the\ninterstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows.",

Notably,\nASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with\nobservations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH\ndiversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent\nwith observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy\nluminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in\ngalaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive\ngalaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\\rm 200c}>10^{15}\\ M_{\\odot}$, and\n9709 halos have $M_{\\rm 200c}>10^{13}\\ M_{\\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass\ncontent in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and\nhalo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the\n$z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to\nthe matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\\rm BH}\\geq 10^{8}\\\nM_{\\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\\star}\\geq 10^{10.5}\\ M_{\\odot}$ serve as good\ntracers of large-scale structure.",

    "summary": "As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace\nRoman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold\nouter planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established\nseveral science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key\nadvantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow\ndetection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman\nmust measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20%\nprecision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that\n>40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that\nthe GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by\ncomparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from\ndetailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing\nevents with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly\n1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass\nand distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for\nRoman-era microlensing science.",

For CMB\nlensing convergence $\\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we\ncompare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH).

For\nCMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\\ell$'s yield similar\nconstraints in forecasts for the $\\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South\nPole Telescope.

Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)\nmeasurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is\norders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and\nmany hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be\nmet congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of\ncosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR\nleptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the\nCMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the\npressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and\nX-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they\nreveal \\textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}.\nConversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional\nthermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ\nsignal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \\& X-rays\ntogether unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure\nrelative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and\nAGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently\nobserved constraints at M$_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{\\rm 12} \\rm M_\\odot$ imply the\nhalo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.",

    "summary": "Extragalactic nebular emission has long been a workhorse probe of the\nprocesses driving galaxy evolution, but the richness of JWST spectroscopy has\nshifted the bottleneck from data acquisition to physical interpretation and\nmodelling. In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular\nline and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal\nequilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver\nand radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately\nbalancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination,\ncollisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling,\nfree-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where\nnon-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling\nprescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures\nin the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the\nequilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously\nexcessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and\ncold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement\na level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate\ncooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines,\ntogether with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from\nfree-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to\nthe high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line\nratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular\nemission across cosmic time.",

Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear\nfield using the $\\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a\ncomprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic\nfeedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape\nnoise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements\nfor 2-point shear correlation functions $\\xi_{\\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs\n$\\zeta_{\\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having\nvalidated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly\nexamined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of\nsource galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for\nStage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for\nthe likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling\ndistribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the\nlikelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of\n$90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs\nmasked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is\nvalidated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates.

    "summary": "Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) play a crucial role in galaxy formation and\nevolution by altering gas dynamics and chemistry across multiple scales.\nTypical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion\ncoefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical\nstudies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the\nphase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that\nself-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and\nadvection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models\nfor CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an\nisolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The\nresulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic\nenergy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to\ncalculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend\ncritically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting\ndiffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\\rm\ncm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100\n~\\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their\nenvironment. Using simple approximations, we show that the gamma ray luminosity\nof the galaxy depends primarily on the gas surface density and the turbulent\nconfinement of CRs by the galactic corona.",

We find that higher spin suppresses the mass\naccretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down\nand secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane.\nCollisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin\ncorrelation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \\simeq 2.8$, much\nlarger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely\nindependent of the local DM density and the spike slope.

Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for\nneutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant\nneutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being\nspatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky.\nIts energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral\nindex $\\gamma = 3.4 \\pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed\nneutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of\nmagnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the\nsource, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT\nspectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters.\nWhen testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\\sigma$\nexcess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample.\nOur results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic\nnuclei are neutrino emitters.",

    "summary": "The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the\nanisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature\ngives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the\ngravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear\nanalyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the\nconduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a\npseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global\nMTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth\nrates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined\nwithin an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed\nto grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of\nthe global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any\nastrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.",

    "summary": "Dark matter (DM) plays a crucial role in explaining the observed\nastrophysical anomalies, galaxy rotation curves, and other fundamental\ncharacteristics of the Universe. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM),\nsuch as the dark hidden-sector model, provide an attractive framework in which\nDM can couple to SM particles via various portals. These portals give rise to\nseveral possible new particles beyond the SM, such as light Higgs bosons, dark\nphotons, and axion-like particles. Furthermore, the origin of DM and the\nobserved asymmetry between visible matter and antimatter may be connected\nthrough the introduction of a dark baryon. If the masses of these hypothetical\nparticles lie in the few-GeV range, they can be explored at high-intensity\n$e^+e^-$ collider experiments, such as the BESIII experiment. This report\npresents a review of recent BESIII results related to searches for dark-sector\nparticles.",

No tidal tails of the clusters were detected, which most\nlikely had been destroyed when the cluster passed through the Galactic plane.\nThe size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric\nparameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass\nspectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of\nlow-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the\ncore region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars\n(just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from\n0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt & Reffert samples showed\nthat almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we\nselected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging\nto clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It\nis shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to\nthe `stellar magnitude -- color index' diagrams) is significantly smaller than\nthe velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.",

    ],
    "summary": "We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and\nsubcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes\nstrongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of\ndifferent gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star\nclusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster\nexpulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among\ninitial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel\n(monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and\nblack hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion\nenables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within\nthe tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate\nto slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas\nexpulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity\ndistribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which\ngoverns both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding\nclusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making\nthem prime candidates for black hole searches with {\\it Gaia}. Our results\nhighlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation\nmechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole\nproduction. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial\nconditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star\nformation community.",

    "summary": "Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the\nwidely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for\ntheir formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely\nunderstood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in\nisolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the\nso-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness.\nHowever, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body\nmodels of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random\nmotions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo,\nwe explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing\nbar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both\nprograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short\ntimescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for\nmoderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to\naccelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo\nspin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might\narise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the\ndark matter halo.",

    "summary": "Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical\nswing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar\ninstability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation\nprocess or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies\nfound that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass\nfraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as \"Fujii relation\"), but they only\nexplored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$\n(local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are\nnot fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation\nin a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and\nscale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with\nphysically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar\nformation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and\nscale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk.\nWe propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation\ntimescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent\nobservations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar\ndisks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ to\n$12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble\ntimescale in some extreme cases.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the statistical properties of isothermal turbulence\nin both the subsonic and supersonic regimes. The focus is on the influence of\nthe Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local\nand scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density,\nvelocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out\nhydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled\n$Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of\nthe gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast,\nderivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the\nprobability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density\ngradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails\nwith growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently\nhigh $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level\ndetermined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited\nby viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic\nenergy through a compressible form of the K\\'arm\\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM)\nequation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found\nbetween subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling\napplies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more\nclosely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms\nin the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an\nadditional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales.\nMoreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour\nwith increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and\nacting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.",

    "summary": "Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era\nLyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the\nneutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing\nvariance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field\nfluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we\npresent new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~\n7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The\nerrorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our\nresults are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.",

This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the\ncommonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass\nevolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a\nfunction of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model\nrecently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only\nBAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test\nthat uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift\nrange. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find\na significantly stronger (> 9{\\sigma}) tension with the {\\Lambda}CDM model than\nthat reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy\nequation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.",

The\nthermal electron density, $n_{\\rm e}$, can also be divided into large-scale,\ndiffuse, $\\langle n_{\\rm e} \\rangle$, and small-scale, clumpy, $\\delta n_{\\rm\ne}$, components. Estimating the properties of $b$ and $\\delta n_{\\rm e}$ from\nobservations, even within the Milky Way, has long been challenging. This work\naddresses the challenge using pulsars, which probe the Milky Way's\nmagneto-ionic medium. Using data of more than 1200 pulsars from the Australia\nTelescope National Facility pulsar catalogue, we combine dispersion (${\\rm\nDM}$) and rotation (${\\rm RM}$) measures with theoretical models to estimate\nboth small- and large-scale properties of the Galactic magnetic field and\nthermal electron density.

However, the small PSF\nsize provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making\nit difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions\nunusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each\nexposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4\narcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF\nexhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed.\nAdditionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the\nfilters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no\nsignificant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time\n(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212\n(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS.

By explicitly including both\nplanetesimal accretion and the prolonged luminous pre-main-sequence phase of M\ndwarfs, we find lower water inventories for the inner TRAPPIST-1 analogs (b-e),\nspanning only $10^{-4}$-$10^{-2} M_{\\oplus,\\rm ocn}$ across a wide range of\ndisk structures and impact scenarios. By contrast, the outer planets (f-h\nanalogs) frequently retain water inventories exceeding an Earth ocean mass.\nThis systematic volatile gradient provides a physically motivated explanation\nfor JWST's nondetections of atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b and c, implying an\norigin rooted in formation conditions rather than in post-formation escape. Our\nresults suggest that many rocky planets in compact M-dwarf systems may form\nalready depleted in volatile compounds, fundamentally limiting their capacity\nto sustain atmospheres or surface oceans. More broadly, our multistage\nframework for volatile tracking can help interpret future observations of\ncompact systems and set more realistic initial conditions for exoplanet\ninterior compositions and atmospheric models.",

By\ncombining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into\n13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different\nfamilies, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of\nthe DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident\nin the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After\ncorrecting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy\nmorphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa\ntypes. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations < 70,\nfollowing a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal\nstructures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and\nlow-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF)\nand decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately\ndescribe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total\nGSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The\nabundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are\npredominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally\nyounger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type\ngalaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass\nto the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust\ndataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine\nlearning-based morphological classifications.",

To\ndate, Perseus remains the only cluster that has been extensively mapped out to\n~0.7$r_{2500}$ by XRISM/Resolve, while simultaneously offering sufficient\nspatial resolution to resolve gaseous substructures driven by mergers and AGN\nfeedback. Our observations cover multiple radial directions and a broad\ndynamical range, enabling us to characterize the intracluster medium kinematics\nup to the scale of ~500 kpc. In the measurements, we detect high velocity\ndispersions ($\\simeq$300 km/s) in the eastern region of the cluster,\ncorresponding to a nonthermal pressure fraction of $\\simeq$7-13%. The velocity\nfield outside the AGN-dominant region can be effectively described by a single,\nlarge-scale kinematic driver based on the velocity structure function, which\nstatistically favors an energy injection scale of at least a few hundred kpc.\nThe estimated turbulent dissipation energy is comparable to the gravitational\npotential energy released by a recent merger, implying a significant role of\nturbulent cascade in the merger energy conversion. In the bulk velocity field,\nwe observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an\namplitude of $\\simeq\\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by\nthe recent merger event. This feature constrains the viewing direction to\n~30$^\\circ$-50$^\\circ$ relative to the normal of the merger plane. Our\nhydrodynamic simulations suggest that Perseus has experienced at least two\nenergetic mergers since redshift z~1, the latest associated with the radio\ngalaxy IC310. This study showcases exciting scientific opportunities for future\nmissions with high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities (e.g., HUBS, LEM, and\nNewAthena).",

    "summary": "Galaxy mergers are transformative events that can cause gaseous inflows\ncapable of triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous studies of AGN in\nsimulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between\napproximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and,\ntherefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor\ninteractions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto\nsupermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from\nthe IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\\mu>$1:100. We select\npost-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\\leq z< 1$, with\nstellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in\npost-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass\nratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in\npost-mergers of 1:40$\\leq \\mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and\nas many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\\mu \\geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN\nexcess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of\nthe mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the\nsimulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\\mu \\geq\n$1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked\nin observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated\nwith recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it\nchallenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep\ngalaxy surveys.",

In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type\nPNG, parameterised by $f_{\\rm NL}$, with $\\sigma_{f_{\\rm NL}} \\sim 1$, would\nprovide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While\ncurrent large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have\nachieved $\\sigma_{f_{\\rm NL}} \\sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel\ndata compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically\ncombines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural\nsummary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a\ncombination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time\nnon-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that\nextracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number\ndensity field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum\nand bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher\ninformation of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass\ncuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based\nfield-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$, reaching\ngains of $30$-$45\\%$ at low $k_{\\rm max}$ ($\\sim 0.1 \\, h \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$),\nand capturing information beyond the bispectrum.

The observations reveal two\nopposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The\npair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and\nSNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that\nthe explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation\nof the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the\ncore-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible\nscenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification\nof Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs\namong normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal\nSNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay\ntime distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution\ntimescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar\npopulations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the\nyounger stellar populations in galaxies.",

Surprisingly, in galaxies in the range $0.2\n\\lesssim Z / Z_\\odot \\lesssim 1.5$ previous studies did not find a\n$Z$-dependence of the upper luminosity limit $L_\\mathrm{max}$ of cool SGs.\nHere, we study four extra galaxies with HST and JWST. Observations of the\nextremely low-$Z$ dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 from JWST allow us to go down to $Z /\nZ_\\odot \\approx 1/40$. For cool SGs in all studied galaxies including I Zw 18,\nwe find a constant $L_\\mathrm{max} \\approx 10^{5.6}$L$_\\odot$, similar to\nliterature results for $0.2 \\lesssim Z / Z_\\odot \\lesssim 1.5$. In I Zw 18 and\nthe other studied galaxies, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars has been claimed.\nAlthough we cannot rule out that some of them become intermediate-temperature\nobjects, this paints a picture in which evolved stars with\n$L>10^{5.6}$L$_\\odot$ burn He as hot He-rich stars down to extremely low $Z$.\nWe argue that $Z$-independent late-phase mass loss would be the most likely\nmechanism responsible. Regardless of the exact stripping mechanism, for the\nEarly Universe our results imply a limitation on black hole masses and a\ncontribution of stars born with $M\\gtrsim 30$M$_\\odot$ to its surprisingly\nstrong nitrogen enrichment. We propose a scenario in which single stars at low\n$Z$ emit sufficiently hard ionizing radiation to produce lines of He II and C\nIV. In this scenario, late-phase $Z$-independent mass loss produces hot He-rich\nstars. Due to the well-understood $Z$-dependence of radiation-driven winds of\nhot stars, a window of opportunity would open below 0.2Z$_\\odot$, where\nself-stripped He-rich stars can exist without dense WR winds that absorb hard\nionizing radiation.",

The spectra show broad H and He\nemission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth\nhost-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of\ndisturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct\nthe first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to\ninfrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion\nflow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The\naccretion component implies a black hole mass of $\\log(M_\\bullet/M_\\odot) =\n5.50\\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\\log\n(\\dot{M}/M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \\pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere\nradius of $\\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \\pm 0.1$.

We\ninvestigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB),\nfinding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT\nfrequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB\ntemperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial\nvelocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the\ntotal baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We\nfind evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial\nradius.

Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and\nWeywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution\ntheory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day\narchitecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions\nrequired. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two\nformalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT)\nframework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on\nWeywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital\ndistances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal\ntorques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin,\nhowever, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period\nbased on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value.\nA match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates\nand if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are\ninconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense\nsatellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most\nplausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated\ndwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated\nwarm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis\nbut cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an\nunrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that\nnon-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss,\nor a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's\nrotational evolution.",

We find that H$\\alpha$ emitters are strongly\nclustered at the intersection of the filaments, suggesting a protocluster core.\nIn contrast, Ly$\\alpha$ emitters tend to avoid the dense region and the\nfilaments, likely due to the resonant scattering of Ly$\\alpha$ photons by HII\ngas and/or enhanced dust attenuation in galaxies associated with these\nstructures. These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via\nfilaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early\nphase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there.\nFurther evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved\ngalaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting\naccelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study\nclearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not\nonly in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding\nfilamentary structure. This underscores the critical role of large-scale\nfilaments in efficiently accumulating the cold gas and channeling it to\ngalaxies therein and to the protocluster core. Such vigorous gas assembly\nfacilitates star formation activity and drives galaxy growth in the early stage\nof cluster formation.",

    "summary": "Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental for understanding the integrated\nlight of old stellar populations and galaxy assembly processes. However, the\nrole of hot, evolved stars, such as horizontal branch (HB), extreme HB, and\nblue stragglers, remains poorly constrained. These stars are often\nunderrepresented or entirely excluded from stellar population models, despite\ntheir dominant contribution to the ultraviolet (UV) flux. Their presence can\nbias age estimates by mimicking the spectral signatures of younger populations.\nWe examined the impact of evolved hot stars on the models using two\nwell-studied Galactic GCs with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope photometry\nand integrated spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the\nBlanco Telescope. NGC 2808 and NGC 7089 (M 2) have extended HBs and are proxies\nfor old stellar populations. Integrated spectra were constructed using a color\nmagnitude diagram-based (CMD-based) method, matching observed stars to\nevolutionary phases and then to appropriate synthetic stellar libraries,\nenabling the HB morphology to be taken into account. Our findings show that the\ninclusion of evolved hot stars significantly improves the agreement between the\nmodel and observed spectra from the UV to the optical. The inclusion of these\nphases reduced the residuals in spectral comparisons. Our results reinforce\nthat comprehensive stellar population models incorporating evolved hot\ncomponents are essential to accurately date unresolved systems and to robustly\ntrace formation histories of extragalactic galaxies.",

    "summary": "We investigate the stability of Milky Way analogs (MWAs) in the\n\\texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric\ninstabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the\npresent day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts\nfor stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net\nstability parameter ($Q_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\\Sigma_{c}$),\nand the instability timescale ($\\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We\nfind that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all\nepochs, with $Q_{T}^{\\min}>2$. The stability levels increase toward higher\nredshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the\ndestabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs\nconsistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density\nremains subcritical ($\\Sigma_{g}<\\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying\nthat local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star\nformation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but\nincrease exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining\nthe concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the\neffect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are\nstable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}>1)$, a combination of gas\ndissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even\nwhen $Q_{T}>1$.",

    "summary": "JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift\n($z \\sim 4-8$), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching.\nAccurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but\nremain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at $0.5 < z < 8$ using a\nmass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI\nimaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at $z \\sim 3-8$, are\nvital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that\nnearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the\nUVJ QG region are actually \"Little Red Dots\", for which the UVJ colors were\nwrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI\nreduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming\ngalaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution\nof QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs\n($\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) > 10.3$) decreases rapidly from $n =\n1\\times10^{-5}~\\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=3-4$ to\n$n=2\\times10^{-6}~\\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z = 4-5$, becoming negligible ($n\n\\lesssim 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ ) at $z > 5$. Conversely, low-mass QGs\n($9<\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})<10.3$) maintain a nearly constant number density\n($n\\sim3\\times10^{-6}~\\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$) across $z = 4-8$. This suggests\nlow-mass QGs at $z > 4$ are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched\ngalaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows\nmost underestimate high-mass QG densities at $z>4$ and fail to reproduce the\nconstant low-mass QG density at $z>5$.",
