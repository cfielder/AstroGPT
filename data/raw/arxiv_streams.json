    "summary": "The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the\nMilky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the\nupcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of\nknown streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of\nindividual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality\nand quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation\nthat GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold\nfor all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with\nthe progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a\nsubset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and\ncompleteness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream\ndetection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual\nexpectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in\nthe multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters\nto account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog\ntailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and\ncompleteness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 degree.",

We report the first results of this program with the characterization\nof the TOI-756 system, which consists of TOI-756 b, a transiting sub-Neptune\ncandidate detected by TESS, as well as TOI-756 c, an additional non-transiting\nplanet discovered by NIRPS and HARPS. TOI-756 b is a 1.24-day period\nsub-Neptune with a radius of 2.81 $\\pm$ 0.10 $R_\\oplus$ and a mass of\n9.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ $M_\\oplus$. TOI-756 c is a cold eccentric (e$_c$ = 0.45\n$\\pm$ 0.01) giant planet orbiting with a period of 149.6 days around its star\nwith a minimum mass of 4.05 $\\pm$ 0.11 $M_\\mathrm{jup}$.

This system is unique in the exoplanet landscape, standing as the\nfirst confirmed example of such a planetary architecture around an M dwarf.\nWith a density of 2.42 $\\pm$ 0.49 g cm$^{-3}$, the inner planet, TOI-756 b, is\na volatile-rich sub-Neptune. Assuming a pure H/He envelope, we inferred an\natmospheric mass fraction of 0.023 and a core mass fraction of 0.27, which is\nwell constrained by stellar refractory abundances derived from NIRPS spectra.\nIt falls within the still poorly explored radius cliff and at the lower\nboundary of the Neptune desert, making it a prime target for a future\natmospheric characterization with JWST to improve our understanding of this\npopulation.",

    "summary": "In many applications, one seeks to approximate integration against a positive\nmeasure of interest by a positive discrete measure: a numerical quadrature rule\nwith positive weights. One common desired discretization property is moment\npreservation over a finite dimensional function space, e.g., bounded-degree\npolynomials. Carath\\'{e}odory's theorem asserts that if there is any finitely\nsupported quadrature rule with more nodes than the dimension of the given\nfunction space, one can form a smaller (and hence more efficient) positive,\nnested, quadrature rule that preserves the moments of the original rule.\n  We describe an efficient streaming procedure for Carath\\'{e}odory-Steinitz\npruning, a numerical procedure that implements Carath\\'{e}odory's theorem for\nthis measure compression. The new algorithm makes use of Givens rotations and\non-demand storage of arrays to successfully prune very large rules whose\nstorage complexity only depends on the dimension of the function space. This\napproach improves on a naive implementation of Carath\\'{e}odory-Steinitz\npruning whose runtime and storage complexity are quadratic and linear,\nrespectively, in the size of the original measure. We additionally prove\nmathematical stability properties of our method with respect to a set of\nadmissible, total-variation perturbations of the original measure. Our method\nis compared to two alternate approaches with larger storage requirements:\nnon-negative least squares and linear programming, and we demonstrate\ncomparable runtimes, with improved stability and storage robustness. Finally,\nwe demonstrate practical usage of this algorithm to generate quadrature for\ndiscontinous Galerkin finite element simulations on cut-cell meshes.",

Exploiting our recent\nimplementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh\ncode AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red\nsupergiant envelopes. For $10\\, M_\\odot$ and $20\\, M_\\odot$ core-carbon-burning\nstars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material\nof density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\\; \\mathrm{g\\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar\nenvironment up to $3\\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for\nthe interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly\nanisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\\, M_\\odot\\, \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The\ntotal CSM masses for both simulations are $\\sim 0.01\\, M_\\odot$. Due to\nconvection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular\nvariations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM\naround the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady\nwind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface\nconvection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need\nto be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based\non our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used\nfor SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN\n2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among\nmost hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using\nRubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and\nUVEX.",

CO line detection rates are 81% for the\nCO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2).

In particular, radio continuum (RC)\nobservations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a\nsignificant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the\ndetectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15\ndwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs)\nspanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using\nmulti-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact\nArray, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and\nexplore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is\ndetected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission\ncorrelates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass,\nwhile dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no\nsignificant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that\nthe RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a\nsimple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more\ncomplex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms\nthat a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral\nshapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches.\nAdditionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic\nray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can\nescape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.",

Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old\nstellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the\nold stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of\nmetal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The\nyoung stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all\ngalaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar.\nPreviously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar\nage on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the\naverage over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include\ncontributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of\nthe four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population\nsynthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust\nlanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of\ninterstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone.

These waves are observed to appear near the top and bottom ends of\nthe reconnection-related CS. The simulations demonstrate the presence of\ntermination shock regions above the two ends of the CS. As the reconnection\noutflows escape from the vertical CS and encounter these termination shocks,\nthey undergo partial reflection, redirecting towards the CS terminal fork\nwalls. The identified waves propagate rapidly at a speed of approximately 1400\nkm/s with a period of just 2 s. Concurrently, the time-evolution of intensity\nwithin a small region of the CS terminal fork structures, exhibits a similar\noscillation period of 2 s. All these evidence supports the notion that these\nQFP (Quasi-periodic Fast-Propagating) waves were excited by tuning fork effects\nwithin the CS system. Essentially, the rapid reconnection outflows are\nreflected by the terminal shocks, striking the fork walls at the CS ends.\nMoreover, parts of the oscillations along the tuning fork handle are\ntransformed into thermal energy, accumulating in the CS center and elevating\nthe temperature. This is the first time to report such QFP waves resulting from\ntuning fork effects within the CS during a solar eruption. These waves are\nanticipated to manifest closely following the propagation of CMEs and adjacent\nto the related post-flare loops in observations, with partial confirmation in\ncurrent observations.",

Methods: We took\nspectra of >600 candidate pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in several nearby young\nclusters (NGC 2264 N & S, Collinder 95, and Collinder 359) using MMT/Hectospec.\nThese spectra were analyzed for H{\\alpha} emission and lithium absorption,\nfeatures indicative of low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) still in their PMS\nevolution. We complemented these samples with YSOs identified via Gaia DR3\nvariability. In conjunction with Gaia astrometry, these data enable an analysis\nof cluster structure, kinematics and ages. In particular, we searched for halos\nof YSOs around our targets to test models of young cluster dynamical evolution.\nResults: For the NGC 2264 N & S cluster pair we identified 354 YSOs, while for\nCollinder 95 and 359 we identified 130 and 7 YSOs, respectively. We calculate\nkinematic \"traceback ages\" for YSOs in these clusters, which we compare to\nisochronal ages estimated using several sets of stellar evolution models. We\nfind for NGC 2264 N & S that kinematic ages are generally smaller than their\nisochronal ages, which may indicate these systems remained bound for a few Myr\nbefore their current state of expansion. On the other hand, kinematic ages for\nCollinder 95 are often significantly larger than isochronal ages, which implies\nmany of these YSOs did not originate from a central, dense region, leading to\noverestimated kinematic ages. Conclusions: We conclude that NGC 2264 N & S\nclusters likely formed as initially bound and compact systems, but have been\ngradually evaporating as cluster members become unbound, forming halos of\nunbound YSOs surrounding the cluster cores. We conclude that Collinder 95\nlikely formed initially sparse and substructured and has been dispersing since\ngas expulsion.",

By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified\ncandidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to\nfiltering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives.

Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the\ncometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age\ndistribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants.

    "summary": "The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are\noften assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very\nsmall. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells,\nwhich are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield\nresults that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to\nextrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory\nmodels and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be\nobtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling\ninstead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of\nBoussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this\nset-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal'\nproperties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the\nconvective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde\nequatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective\nRossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties\nis regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the\nconvective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are\ndiffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a\ndiffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations\nthat are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large\nscales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are\nobtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are\ndiffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic\nstellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free\nregimes.",

A\nmulti-hierarchy simulation that combines Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and PIC\nprovides a promising means to overcome these spatial and temporal scale gaps.\nWe developed a multi-hierarchy simulation code KAMMUY (Kinetic And\nMagnetohydrodynamic MUlti-hierarchY simulation code), in which an ideal MHD\nsimulation for a large domain and a PIC simulation for a smaller domain are\nsolved in parallel with mutual information exchange. To validate the code, we\nconducted test simulations of MHD wave propagation and the shock tube problem.\nThe results demonstrate that short-wavelength, high-frequency waves generated\nin the PIC region do not propagate into the MHD region, whereas MHD-scale\nstructures propagate smoothly into the PIC region, highlighting the capability\nof our code for numerical studies of magnetic reconnection. By applying the\nKAMMUY code to magnetic reconnection while varying the PIC domain size, we find\nthat the reconnection rate remains unchanged, regardless of the extent of the\nPIC region where the Hall magnetic field is present. It suggests that the\nspatial extension of the Hall magnetic field on the scale of $10 \\sim 100\n\\lambda_i$ does not influence the reconnection rate.",

    "summary": "High abundances of various lead (Pb) species have been identified in the\nspectra of many Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and O- and B-type subdwarfs\n(sdO/B). Additional atomic data relating to Pb, and in particular\nphotoionization cross sections, are needed to allow a greater understanding of\nthe origin of these observed Pb abundances, and hence discern the evolutionary\npathway of these stars. We have calculated level-resolved photoionization cross\nsections for Pb III, IV, V and VI. Four new target structures have been\ndeveloped with the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (GRASP0),\nwhose corresponding energy levels, Einstein A-coefficients and oscillator\nstrengths have been found to be in good agreement with previous experimental\nand theoretical sources. The photoionization cross sections calculated using\nthe Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes (DARC) are available in TOPBASE format, and\nfollow the trends expected for an isonuclear series. These new Pb data sets\nwill now allow for the modelling of Pb abundances and line opacities under\nNon-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. Using the helium-rich\nhot subdwarf EC 22536-5304 as a test case, we show that there are noticeable\ndifferences in the Pb line profiles across the ultraviolet and optical\nwavelength regions under LTE and non-LTE conditions. There is both depletion\nand enrichment of individual Pb species. This highlights the importance of\napplying non-LTE conditions when modelling EC 22536-5304, as well as other\nO/B-type stars.",

    "summary": "We introduce a new method for predicting sunspot number (SSN) that, based on\nsuccessful back projections, can predict features of the SSN several solar\ncycles in advance. The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN\nrecord, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong\ncomponents in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker\ncomponents in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each\ncomponent is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The\ncomponents are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for\nback/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term\nfeatures of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like\ngrand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of\nshort term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal\ncontribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution\nboth in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN\namplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of\ncycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may\nemerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and\n27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the\namplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle\n30, occurring around 2070. Macro changes in SSN such as the occurrence of grand\nsolar minima and maxima and micro changes such as the Waldmeier Effect are\nexplained in terms of interference between the octal and decadal components\nevident in the SSN spectrum. The explanation differs from current theories that\nsuggest SSN variability is due to stochastic forcing of a single solar dynamo\nprocess.",

    "summary": "Tracing the water snowline in low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) is\nimportant because dust grain growth is promoted and the chemical composition\nvaries at the water snowline, which influences planet formation and its\nproperties. In protostellar envelopes, the water snowline can be estimated as a\nfunction of luminosity using a relation derived from radiative transfer models,\nand these predictions are consistent with observations. However, accurately\nestimating the water snowline in protoplanetary disks requires new relations\nthat account for the disk structure. We present the relations between\nluminosity and water snowline using the dust continuum radiative transfer\nmodels with various density structures. We adopt two-dimensional density\nstructures for an envelope-only model (Model E), an envelope+disk+cavity model\n(Model E+D), and a protoplanetary disk model (Model PPD). The relations between\nthe water snowline, where T_dust = 100 K, and the total luminosity, ranging\n0.1-1,000 solar luminosity, are well fitted by a power-law relation, R_snow=a *\n(L/L_solar)^p au. The factor a decreases with increasing disk density, while\nthe power index p has values around 0.5 in all models. As the disk becomes\ndenser, the water snowline forms at smaller radii even at the same luminosity,\nsince dense dust hinders photon propagation. We also explore the effect of\nviscous heating on the water snowline. In Model PPD with viscous heating, the\nwater snowline shifts outward by a few au up to 15 au, increasing the factor a\nand decreasing the power index p. In Model E+D with lower disk mass, the effect\nof viscous heating is negligible, indicating that the disk mass controls the\neffect. The discrepancy between our models and direct observations provides\ninsights into the recent outburst event and the presence of a disk structure in\nlow-mass YSOs.",

Existing guardrail\nmodels, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations\nin real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary \"safe/unsafe\"\nlabels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,\nrendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across\ndomains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety\nchecks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,\nthereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing\nexposure to harmful partial outputs.

To overcome these challenges,\nthis study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network\n(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module\nincorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent\nstates, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase\ndifferences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly\ncaptures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and\nthe structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional\ncross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated\nthrough a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained\nwith a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction\nerrors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments\non wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms\nmainstream models.

The explanation most often put forth is that a shutdown or\nmode change in the stellar dynamo leads to a sharp decrease in angular momentum\nloss in magnetized coronal winds. In this paper, we explore an alternate\npossibility, namely a collapse of the wind itself through a reduction of\ncoronal heating. We show that in the low coronal temperature ($T_0$) limit,\neven at solar-like low rotation rates ($\\Omega$) and coronal magnetic field\nstrength ($B_{r0}$), magnetocentrifugal effects are important and preclude\nexpression of the mass and angular momentum loss rates as power-laws of $T_0$\nor $\\Omega$ when $T_0$ drops below $\\simeq 1.5\\,$MK.

Our analysis makes use of $1.6$\nmillion galaxies with stellar masses $\\log M_\\star/M_\\odot > 10$, and we\nexplore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1' < \\theta_{\\rm ap}\n< 3.5'$) and stellar mass selections. This statistic directly probes the\nvelocity field of the large-scale structure, a unique observable of cosmic\ndynamics and modified gravity. In particular, at low redshifts, this quantity\nis especially interesting, as deviations from General Relativity are expected\nto be largest. Notably, our result represents the highest-significance\nlow-redshift ($z \\sim 0.3$) detection of the kSZ pairwise effect yet. In our\nmost optimal configuration ($\\theta_{\\rm ap} = 3.3'$, $\\log M_\\star > 11$), we\nachieve a $5\\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth\nand galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this\nmeasurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f\n\\sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth.\nWe address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo\nmass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates\nof the mean optical depth, $\\bar \\tau$. We stress that this is a\nproof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the\nstatistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust\ntests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low\nredshift.",

Machine learning methods can extract compact and\ninformative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source\nCatalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains\nlargely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and\nphysically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep\nlearning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant\ninformation, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and\ninterpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress\nX-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only\nhigh-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary\nstatistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned\nrepresentation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering\nperformance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with\nphysical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density\n($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent\nvariables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification\naccuracy of $\\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\\sim$69% when\nrestricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,\nlatent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,\nsuggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant\ninformation. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the\nrepresentation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent\nspace that supports both classification and the estimation of physical\nproperties.

    "summary": "Magnetism is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics\nof stars, though little is known about magnetic fields deep within stellar\ninteriors. A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic\nobservations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic\nwaves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative\ninterior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the\nsuppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of\nhigh-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows\nthat core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by\nrefracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at\nmagnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric\ncase, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of\nAlfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior\nwith uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic\nfield. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the\nvertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that\nIGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and\nproduce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric\ncase), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the\nbackground magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid\ndamping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and\nnon-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field.",

To\nbetter understand their impact on planet formation, it is essential to study\ntheir physical and chemical properties. In this framework, we aim to\ncharacterize the longest streamer identified in carbon chain emission within\nthe Class I system L1489 IRS, connecting the nearby prestellar core L1489 to\nthe young stellar object (YSO). We observed multiple transitions of C$_2$H,\northo-c-C$_3$H$_2$, and HC$_3$N in L1489 IRS with NOEMA and IRAM-30m at 3mm and\n2mm. Using a variety of radiative transfer methods, including a hyperfine\nstructure (HFS) fitting, rotational diagrams, and proposing a new\nself-consistent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach combined with the\nnon-LTE RADEX code, we derived the column densities and abundances of those\nmolecules, as well as the H$_2$ number density along the streamer. This enabled\nus to estimate its mass, infall rate, and its impact on the {star+disk}\nsystem's mass. We found lower limits on the streamer mass of\n$\\geq(4.67-18.3)\\times10^{-3}$ $M_\\odot$ (i.e., $\\geq0.65-2.57$ times the\ncurrent disk mass) and an infall rate of $\\geq(1.94-7.57)\\times10^{-7}$\n$M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, where the ranges correspond to the different molecular\ntracers. These values are consistent with those derived in similar Class I\nobjects. This suggests that the disk could be fully replenished by streamer\nmaterial. Given its mass, the streamer is likely at the origin of the external\nwarped disk seen in this system, as predicted by numerical simulations.\nMoreover, the first investigations based on the C$_2$H/c-C$_3$H$_2$ and\nHC$_3$N/c-C$_3$H$_2$ abundance ratios suggest that the streamer chemistry may\nbe inherited from the core.

The method builds\non an explicit M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation\n(RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a\ncomplementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick\nregions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside\nprotostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining\nthe advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the\nconventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically\nthick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near\ntheir surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring\ncells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number\ndensities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective\nlocal spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency\ntransport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code\nSFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an\napplication, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at\nhigh redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a\ncontinuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk,\nwhich cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models.

    "summary": "Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400\nyears. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with\nextended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple\nring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole\nelectromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over\nthe past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a)\nsubmillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the\nejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in\nthe ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time\nevolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity\nejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for\nhigh angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made\nsignificant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of\nredshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre\nof the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot\nneutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.",

    "summary": "The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the\nfascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of\nprotons to energies >300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of\nSGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This\nreport covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been\noperating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle\n(SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many\nstudies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The\nnumber of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs\nconfirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi\nLAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues\nhas been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem\nwith a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and\nthe number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II\nbursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred\nthan the 15 events observed by Fermi.",

To confirm the existence of this oscillation and\nprecisely measure its period, I conducted extensive photometric observations of\nthe object over 25 nights between 2022 and 2024. The total duration of these\nobservations was 139 hr. The observations revealed the oscillation on each\nobservation night. This oscillation was coherent throughout all the\nobservations covering 18 months. Due to the large coverage of observations, I\nwas able to determine the oscillation period with high precision. It was found\nto be 41.485867+\\-0.000026 min. The semi-amplitude of the oscillation was\nlarge, averaging 0.154(2) mag. The pulse profile of the oscillation did not\nchange during the observations and followed a perfect sinusoidal pattern. With\nthe high precision of the period, I created an ephemeris for the oscillation\nwith a validity time of 30 years. This ephemeris can be used in future studies\nof changes in the oscillation period. Although short-period X-ray oscillations\nhave not yet been detected in 1RXS J014549.6+514314, the high coherence of its\n41-minute oscillation suggests that this object is most likely to be an\nintermediate polar.",

This study provides\nthe first quantitative assessment of how missing risk markets affect investment\ndecisions in power systems that depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES)\nfor reliability. We develop a two-stage stochastic equilibrium model with\nrisk-averse market participants, which independently sizes power and energy\ncapacity. We apply the method to a case study of a deeply decarbonised power\nsystem in Great Britain. The results show that incomplete risk markets reduce\nsocial welfare, harm reliability, and discourage investment in LDES and other\ntechnologies with volatile revenue streams. Revenue volatility leads to\nsubstantial risk premiums and higher financing costs for LDES, creating a\nbarrier to its large-scale deployment.

Some of these stars exhibit enhanced s-process and/or\nr-process elements, hence are classified as CEMP-s, CEMP-rs, or CEMP-r. This\nclassification is challenging due to the limited availability of heavy element\nabundances, particularly among r-process elements. Heavy r-process elements\nsuch as terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, tantalum, and iridium\nhave rarely been measured because their sensitive lines are located in the\nultraviolet. However, they provide sensitive diagnostics of the s-, r-, and i-\nnucleosynthetic processes. In this work, we aim to obtain a secure\nclassification of CEMP-s and -rs stars and investigate whether the i-process\ncan account for the measured abundance patterns in CEMP-rs stars. We derive the\nabundance profiles, notably for twelve heavy r-elements, including, in some\ncases, tantalum, using high-resolution UVES spectra of seventeen CEMP-s and -rs\nstars. Based on indicators such as the [s/r] abundance ratio or the\nmodel-independent 'abundance distance', nine stars are confirmed as CEMP-rs and\nsix as CEMP-s. The classification of two objects remains uncertain. The\ni-process satisfactorily reproduces the abundance patterns of CEMP-rs stars.\nHowever, larger samples are needed to confirm trends with metallicity and\nclarify how CEMP-rs stars differ from CEMP-s stars.",

    "summary": "As the popularity of video streaming entertainment continues to grow,\nunderstanding how users engage with the content and react to its changes\nbecomes a critical success factor for every stakeholder. User engagement, i.e.,\nthe percentage of video the user watches before quitting, is central to\ncustomer loyalty, content personalization, ad relevance, and A/B testing. This\npaper presents DIGITWISE, a digital twin-based approach for modeling adaptive\nvideo streaming engagement. Traditional adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms\nassume that all users react similarly to video streaming artifacts and network\nissues, neglecting individual user sensitivities. DIGITWISE leverages the\nconcept of a digital twin, a digital replica of a physical entity, to model\nuser engagement based on past viewing sessions. The digital twin receives input\nabout streaming events and utilizes supervised machine learning to predict user\nengagement for a given session. The system model consists of a data processing\npipeline, machine learning models acting as digital twins, and a unified model\nto predict engagement. DIGITWISE employs the XGBoost model in both digital\ntwins and unified models. The proposed architecture demonstrates the importance\nof personal user sensitivities, reducing user engagement prediction error by up\nto 5.8% compared to non-user-aware models. Furthermore, DIGITWISE can optimize\ncontent provisioning and delivery by identifying the features that maximize\nengagement, providing an average engagement increase of up to 8.6%.",

    "summary": "We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and\nsubcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes\nstrongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of\ndifferent gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star\nclusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster\nexpulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among\ninitial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel\n(monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and\nblack hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion\nenables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within\nthe tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate\nto slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas\nexpulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity\ndistribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which\ngoverns both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding\nclusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making\nthem prime candidates for black hole searches with {\\it Gaia}. Our results\nhighlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation\nmechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole\nproduction. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial\nconditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star\nformation community.",

While the\nwidely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for\ntheir formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely\nunderstood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in\nisolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the\nso-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness.\nHowever, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body\nmodels of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random\nmotions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo,\nwe explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing\nbar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both\nprograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short\ntimescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for\nmoderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to\naccelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo\nspin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might\narise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the\ndark matter halo.",

    "summary": "Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical\nswing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar\ninstability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation\nprocess or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies\nfound that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass\nfraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as \"Fujii relation\"), but they only\nexplored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$\n(local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are\nnot fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation\nin a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and\nscale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with\nphysically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar\nformation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and\nscale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk.\nWe propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation\ntimescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent\nobservations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar\ndisks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ to\n$12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble\ntimescale in some extreme cases.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the statistical properties of isothermal turbulence\nin both the subsonic and supersonic regimes. The focus is on the influence of\nthe Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local\nand scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density,\nvelocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out\nhydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled\n$Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of\nthe gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast,\nderivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the\nprobability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density\ngradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails\nwith growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently\nhigh $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level\ndetermined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited\nby viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic\nenergy through a compressible form of the K\\'arm\\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM)\nequation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found\nbetween subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling\napplies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more\nclosely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms\nin the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an\nadditional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales.\nMoreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour\nwith increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and\nacting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.",

We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,\nwhich treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which\ngeometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive\ntight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between\nthe model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under\ngradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE\nvanishes asymptotically with a $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas\ndiscounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount\nfactor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step.

To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural\nLanguage Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based\nplanning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural\nlanguage messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in\ndecision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego\nCAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information\nexchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively\nexpress their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that\nmaximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate\nonly the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the\nscalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse\ndriving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%\nincrease in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and\na four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.\nProject website: https://uncap-project.github.io/",

Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i)\nfor $M/ M_\\odot\\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically\nunstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\\odot\\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always\npresent; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\\lesssim M / M_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability\ndepends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the\nnuclear-cusp slope.

To address this question, we adopt a statistical\napproach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all\nknown constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics\n(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given\nEOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of\nthe sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture\nfor a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.\nHowever, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that\nit is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the\ncompactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for\nthe maximum compactness and is given by $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm max} = 1/3$.\nImportantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass\nand a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.",

    "summary": "We present the MaNGA Visual Morphology (MVM) catalogue, featuring a visual\nmorphological classification of 10,059 galaxies in the final MaNGA sample. By\ncombining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into\n13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different\nfamilies, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of\nthe DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident\nin the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After\ncorrecting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy\nmorphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa\ntypes. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations < 70,\nfollowing a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal\nstructures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and\nlow-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF)\nand decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately\ndescribe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total\nGSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The\nabundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are\npredominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally\nyounger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type\ngalaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass\nto the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust\ndataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine\nlearning-based morphological classifications.",

Therefore, this potential vital link needs testing by\ncharacterising exoplanets around chemically-diverse stars. We present the\ndiscovery of two planets orbiting the metal-poor, kinematic thick-disk K-dwarf\nTOI-2345. TOI-2345 b is a super-Earth with a period of 1.05 days and TOI-2345 c\nis a sub-Neptune with a period of 21 days. In addition to the target being\nobserved in 4 TESS sectors, we obtained 5 CHEOPS visits and 26 radial\nvelocities from HARPS. By conducting a joint analysis of all the data, we find\nTOI-2345 b to have a radius of $1.504\\substack{+0.047\\\\-0.044}$ R$_\\oplus$ and\na mass of $3.49\\pm0.85$ M$_\\oplus$; and TOI-2345 c to have a radius of\n$2.451\\substack{+0.045\\\\-0.046}$ R$_\\oplus$ and a mass of\n$7.27\\substack{+2.27\\\\-2.45}$ M$_\\oplus$. To explore chemical links between\nthese planets and their host star, we model their interior structures newly\naccounting for devolatised stellar abundances. TOI-2345 adds to the limited\nsample of well characterised planetary systems around thick disk stars. This\nsystem challenges theories of formation and populations of planets around thick\ndisk stars with its Ultra-Short Period super-Earth and the wide period\ndistribution of these two planets spanning the radius valley.",

Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by\nachieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we\npropose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework\ntowards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408\nvideos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a\ntrain-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming\nsuper-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts\nredundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a\ntiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing\nquality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new\ndataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that\nFlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step\ndiffusion VSR models.

    "summary": "Galaxy mergers are transformative events that can cause gaseous inflows\ncapable of triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous studies of AGN in\nsimulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between\napproximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and,\ntherefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor\ninteractions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto\nsupermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from\nthe IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\\mu>$1:100. We select\npost-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\\leq z< 1$, with\nstellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in\npost-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass\nratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in\npost-mergers of 1:40$\\leq \\mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and\nas many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\\mu \\geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN\nexcess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of\nthe mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the\nsimulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\\mu \\geq\n$1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked\nin observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated\nwith recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it\nchallenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep\ngalaxy surveys.",

We present the first GPU\nalgorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the\nNextLA$.$jl open-source software package.

We demonstrate highly parallel bandwidth-bound algorithm on the GPU\ncan outperform CPU-based implementations: the GPU algorithm outperforms\nmultithreaded CPU High-Performance libraries PLASMA and SLATE as of matrix size\n1024 x 1024 and by a factor over 100 for matrices of 32k x 32k. In addition,\nthe performance of the algorithm increases linearly with matrix bandwidth size,\nmaking faster reduction of larger matrix bandwidths now also possible.

The observations reveal two\nopposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The\npair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and\nSNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that\nthe explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation\nof the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the\ncore-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible\nscenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification\nof Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs\namong normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal\nSNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay\ntime distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution\ntimescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar\npopulations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the\nyounger stellar populations in galaxies.",

We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to\nEO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral\ninputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages\ndependencies across time.

Trained on\nSentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x\nstronger compression at equivalent image quality.

Only recently, some\nevidence of the existence of nonthermal electrons at locations outside these\nwell-accepted regions has been found. Here, we report for the first time\nmultiple cases of transient nonthermal emissions, in the heliocentric range of\n$\\sim 3-7R_\\odot$, which do not have any obvious counterparts in other\nwavebands, like white-light and extreme ultra-violet. These detections were\nmade possible by the regular availability of high dynamic range low-frequency\nradio images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array.\nWhile earlier detections of nonthermal emissions at these high heliocentric\ndistances often had comparable extensions in the plane-of-sky, they were\nprimarily been associated with radio CMEs, unlike the cases reported here.\nThus, these results add on to the evidence that the middle corona is extremely\ndynamic and contains a population of nonthermal electrons, which is only\nbecoming visible with high dynamic range low-frequency radio images.",

We present the pilot\nof a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying\nstellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally\nresolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for\noutflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical\nimaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA\n21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST\nphotometry.

Though the galaxy\nis experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong\noutflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though\nstar formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the\ngalaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to\nproduce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling\noutflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how\nstellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper\nunderstanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar\nmedium in low-mass galaxies.",
